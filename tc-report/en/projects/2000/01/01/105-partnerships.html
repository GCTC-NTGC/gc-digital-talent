                    A Home in the Office of the Chief Information Officer
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Talent Cloud was a bit of a renegade project when it first
                    started - an experimental theory on staffing with a focus on
                    digital talent. It wasn’t an easy fit to the existing
                    government organizational structure, and people weren’t sure
                    where it belonged (or if it should belong anywhere).
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    It’s not an exaggeration to say that Talent Cloud wouldn’t
                    have existed if it wasn’t for the Chief Information Officer
                    of Canada in 2017 - Alex Benay - standing up to make a home
                    for the project and giving it a focus. When Talent Cloud
                    initially came to the Office of the Chief Information
                    Officer, it was little more than a proposal and a small
                    grassroots start-up. There wasn’t even any certainty that
                    the project would (or should) belong in the organization
                    long term.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    But for anyone who’s worked in start-ups, you know how
                    critical those early champions are. Our project was
                    fortunate enough to have several, including the Chief
                    Information Officer, the Deputy Clerk of the Privy Council,
                    and an Executive Director who believed in the potential of
                    the experiment.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Over the years, there have been a number of changes in these
                    leadership roles, but Talent Cloud has been supported by a
                    succession of champions who continue to promote the
                    research. The Office of the Chief Information Officer
                    (Treasury Board Secretariat) has also been the project’s
                    largest funding supporter in each of its years of operation.

                    Partnership Structure
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Talent Cloud was funded through contributions from partner
                    departments who wanted to support the experiment’s research
                    direction and use the platform itself for hiring term
                    appointments. These agreements were made on an annual basis
                    in the form of Memorandums of Understanding.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    It was challenging to run a project like Talent Cloud with
                    the variable nature of the funding that comes with this type
                    of partnership structure, but there’s simply no way the
                    project would have ever existed without the aid of these
                    partner departments. While not all partner departments
                    funded all years of the project, it’s impossible to
                    overstate the importance of their participation. Without the
                    support, intellectual curiosity, passion, and perseverance
                    of our project partners, Talent Cloud would never have made
                    it past the early planning stages.

                    The partnership model was also only able to cover
                    approximately half the costs of operations in later years as
                    the project grew into a full platform. The Office of the
                    Chief Information Officer has absorbed approximately half
                    the operating costs of the project in recent years. (This is
                    an important factor for those looking to run similar
                    experiments. Funding instability has been a significant
                    challenge for our project operations. While our experience
                    may not represent that of others, we’ve found it difficult
                    to raise resources for a medium size experiment, with a
                    funding requirement that’s too small to require a Memorandum
                    to Cabinet, but too large for a single organization to fund
                    alone.)

                <p>
                    The purpose of the External Advisory Board was to provide
                    insight and guidance on the direction of the GC Talent Cloud
                    initiative, including shaping its performance objectives,
                    advancing cross-sector engagement, and providing advice on
                    its longer-term operating model. Board members also
                    contributed ideas on connecting Talent Cloud to broader
                    trends on the future of work, with a central discussion
                    selected for each meeting. Discussion topics included
                    concepts such as data self-sovereignty, the future of
                    workers’ rights, portable benefits, Indigenous inclusion,
                    next generation employment equity, bias reduction in
                    staffing, credential recognition, A.I., blockchain, and
                    digital identity.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Board members represented a diverse range of perspectives,
                    user groups and areas of expertise related to the future of
                    work, public sector transformation, employment equity and
                    human rights. They were considered leaders in their fields,
                    and came from private, not-for-profit, government and
                    academic sectors.

                    While the External Advisory Board met several times a year
                    in the first two years of Talent Cloud’s operations, it was
                    difficult to maintain momentum with all the other components
                    of the project underway. As a result, the board has been
                    inactive since late 2019.

                    As part of their Memorandum of Understanding with Talent
                    Cloud, each partner department appointed one Director
                    General to sit on an advisory committee. This governance
                    body made critical decisions on feature prioritization,
                    received reports on early research findings, and previewed

                <p>
                    As part of their Memorandum of Understanding with Talent
                    Cloud, each partner department appointed one (or more) HR
                    advisors to be part of a working group. Superusers received
                    training on the Talent Cloud platforms operations and
                    experimental objectives, and were asked to observe and
                    report back on how features and tools were functioning in
                    real staffing processes.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    As on-the-ground experts, the HR superuser group was an
                    invaluable source of information for the Talent Cloud
                    project. Meetings were generally opened with the question,
                    “Based on the Talent Cloud features your department has
                    tested since the last meeting, what’s not working for you?
                    What needs improving?” HR advisors would then share stories
                    and offer insights on ways to fix what wasn’t working and
                    add what was missing. These findings were then summarized
                    and shared at each following Director General-level Advisory
                    Committee meeting, helping to inform discussions.

                    HR superusers also acted as user testers in the design of
                    features for the HR Advisor Portal, and provided policy
                    expertise on rules, policies and best practices for the
                    project as a whole. They were an amazing source of guidance,

                    Over the years, the Talent Cloud team has benefited from the
                    policy guidance and expertise of many mandate holders and
                    authorities in government. Without collaboration, we
                    couldn’t have moved the project forward.

                    The Public Service Commission has provided reviews of our

                    Talent Cloud to test an alternative approach to the Priority

                    government were first proposed by a breakthrough theory
                    paper by Deloitte, entitled GovCloud. Talent Cloud and
                    Deloitte shared many discussions on this topic, as well as
                    broader conversations on the future of work. Deloitte’s
                    thought leadership in this area was inspiring.

                    When Talent Cloud first began, resources were very short,
                    and the team didn’t have enough to fund a full coding team
                    in the first year. Deloitte, eager to see someone move to
                    test the GovCloud concept in practice, donated the time of
                    some of its coders and an expert in Agile methodologies to
                    help the team move forward towards proof-of-concept in its
                    early days. The collaboration was all open source - both
                    teams contributed to a common project on GitHub. It did not
                    involve any financial relationship (explicit or implied),
                    and all the code developed from this collaboration was
                    available to the public. To ensure transparency, Talent
                    Cloud and Deloitte also published a Statement of
                    Collaboration on GCcollab.

                    While little of that early code remains in the platform
                    today, two significant contributions from Deloitte have
                    lingered. Firstly, the organization believed in the project
                    at a time when few did, and their thought leadership and
                    enthusiasm continue to inspire us. Secondly, the knowledge
                    Deloitte shared on how to set up to run an agile product
                    team in government is used daily by our team. We’re not sure
                    we would’ve cleared all the hurdles we needed to in those
                    early days without this show of support.

                    Talent Cloud has benefited enormously from ideas sharing
                    with private, not-for-profit, academic and government
                    organizations both here in Canada and internationally. While
                    these knowledge collaborators are too numerous to mention
                    here, it’s important to acknowledge that a project like
                    Talent Cloud can’t be built in a vacuum (unless it plans to
                    spend the rest of its life operating in the vacuum.) The
                    future of work is actively being shaped by thought leaders
                    around the world, and we’re grateful for the insights and
                    research shared.
