                    The Digital Standards were officially released by the Office
                    of the Chief Information Officer in 2018. But for those
                    working on government innovation and digital initiatives,
                    they’d long been considered best practices for achieving
                    meaningful results. To get different outcomes, you must
                    adopt different business processes. To get citizen-centric,
                    digital age results, that means embracing the Digital
                    Standards in all aspects of the work.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    For the Talent Cloud team, the Digital Standards act as a
                    foundation. But unlike a physical foundation, our ability to
                    work in line with the Digital Standards is dynamic. That
                    means the foundation of our team can actually get stronger
                    if we actively maintain what we’re doing well and challenge
                    ourselves in the areas where we can do better. Here’s just a
                    snapshot of how the Digital Standards have helped to shape
                    the project and its outcomes.

                    Our team uses the Agile method, working in two-week sprints.
                    At the end of each sprint, the teams (back end, policy and
                    design) show their progress and look for feedback. New input
                    from live testing and any changes from emerging priorities
                    are integrated into the forward plan the next day. This
                    creates tight feedback loops that help us stay responsive to
                    user input and maintain momentum as we develop and improve
                    features.

                    Talent Cloud was one of the first protected applications in
                    the Government of Canada to move into the cloud. To do this
                    we had to pioneer a new approach to privacy that allowed for
                    iterative improvements to the platform.

                    We’re always in the process of updating our Privacy Impact
                    Assessment (the ultimate government privacy document for
                    applications). As we scope new features that will require
                    collection of new data or handling the same data
                    differently, we are also updating our privacy documentation.
                    Currently we’re working on our third Privacy Impact
                    Assessment, and we intend to keep it evergreen.

                    People are tired of always being asked for the same
                    information. This consistent feedback from users drove our
                    commitment to making reusable skills central to our
                    platform. By breaking up job requirements into individual
                    skills, we allow applicants to only describe those skills
                    once and re-use the same descriptions for future job
                    applications.

                    But that only scratches the surface of what candidates are
                    asked for during the hiring process. To push this idea
                    further, Talent Cloud is working to pilot the use of
                    verifiable credentials. This work would generate trusted
                    records that replace the need to repeatedly assess the same
                    requirements.

                    Designing an ethical staffing platform is the core
                    philosophy of the team. We sum this up as ‘making the good
                    road the easy road’ for our users, and taking the right path
                    to get there as a team, no matter how long or difficult it
                    is in the build phase. This means diving deep into the way
                    policy, product and human nature intersect. It requires
                    working through the complexities of bias reduction,
                    behavioural psychology, and intended and unintended
                    outcomes, and carefully monitoring the outcomes for users.

                    job applicants/employees, hiring managers, and HR Advisors.
                    Our product development cycle includes workshops and early
                    theory testing, followed by wire frame testing sessions with
                    potential users. Once the product is live, we test again
                    with real users, and observe findings over time (not just in
                    the first release.)

                    Talent Cloud has taken a number of steps to advance
                    accessibility beyond meeting WCAG AA standards. One of the

                    with accessibility expertise. This has ensured that
                    accessibility considerations have been part of all of our
                    proposed features at an early stage of design - not as a
                    retrofit of a predetermined feature. We also work with

                        “Designing with users” is key to modern service
                        delivery. But it’s not only the engagement in design
                        that matters. It’s also essential that government teams
                        push themselves to think critically about the diversity
                        of their product’s user base, and whether or not the
                        users who come forward to help with product testing are
                        reflective of that diversity. If not, the product may
                        not perform as well as intended once it hits the real
                        world... or worse, it may perform to the advantage of
                        some user groups at the cost of others. “Designing with
                        users” comes with responsibility. After all, we’re
                        talking about real humans.<br /><br />Talent Cloud’s
                        user testers are drawn from a community that includes
                        (among others) people from a multitude of life paths and
                        regions, Indigenous users, and people with alternative
                        accessibility considerations. Our team is also
                        reflective of this diversity.<br /><br />Canada is a
                        community of communities. Responsible user-centered
                        design must meaningfully embody that diversity all the
                        way through product development - not as an afterthought
                        or an add on. While this isn’t always easy, it’s an
                        ethical imperative and the only way to get a truly high
                        quality product.
