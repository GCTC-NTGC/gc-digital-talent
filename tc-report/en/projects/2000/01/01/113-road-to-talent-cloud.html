                        representing the 1st of 4 phases of Talent Cloud's
                        history. In 2012, Deloitte releases the theory paper
                        "GovCloud". From 2014 to 2016, the idea of Talent Cloud
                        begins to take shape. in November 2016, the team begins
                        pitching the idea. in March 2017, the Chief Information
                        Officer of Canada, Alex Benay, steps forward to host
                        Talent Cloud. In June 2017, four departments offer 1
                        full time employee each to get the project started."

                        <p>
                            The initial team that started Talent Cloud
                            previously worked together at the IN·spire
                            Innovation Hub at Natural Resources Canada from
                            2014-2017, where we ran a number of experiments on
                            talent mobility, including some of the earliest
                            Government of Canada work on micro-missions and
                            portable digital credentials (open badges).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The team also designed and launched the original
                            Free Agents program, along with a fifth team member
                            who became the first program manager. Free Agents
                            grew into an initiative in its own right, but it was
                            strategically designed as an early test of several
                            of the concepts Talent Cloud was hoping to develop
                            at a larger scale, including research on the
                            psychological impact of project-based work on
                            employees. As a commitment to do no harm, the Talent
                            Cloud team wanted to make sure it wasn’t about to
                            build something that would save time and generate
                            efficiencies at the cost of employee mental health.

                        <p>
                            Talent Cloud initially launched as a project in July
                            of 2017, but it took another 15 months before there
                            was a minimal viable live platform. Initially, the
                            team was only able to raise money for 4 FTEs - and
                            only for terms. The team was so committed to the
                            vision that all four initial members gave up their
                            indeterminate status and moved into term positions
                            in a new department. Then we began the process of
                            researching what the platform should look like, and
                            how to test points of intervention in service of the
                            project’s three performance objectives.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            New fiscal year, 2018-19, brought more funding and
                            the chance to a UX designer and our Indigenous
                            Community Liaison. We also hired three developers -
                            a front end developer, an accessibility expert, and
                            a back end developer. The platform launched six
                            months later, in October 2018. Needless to say with
                            our scarce staff compliment, our minimal viable
                            product was very minimal. But it was enough to run
                            real processes and start testing numerous
                            interventions on job advertisement design and volume
                            of applications.

                        <p>
                            After the platform went live in October 2018, the
                            Talent Cloud team had a period of growth. More
                            people were hired, including a behavioural
                            scientist, an industrial psychologist, and more
                            developers. The initial four team members were
                            converted from term employees back to indeterminate
                            status. New partner departments joined the venture.
                            Jobs were live on the platform, and the time to
                            staff was slowly but steadily ticking down, as we
                            tested and refined our interventions. Hiring
                            managers were finding unique talent (when they stuck
                            with the process as designed), and applicants were
                            sending us emails about how great their experience
                            was, even when they weren’t the person who got the
                            job.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But there were also challenges. Hiring managers and
                            HR advisors weren’t always used to working with
                            minimal viable products and experiments. No matter
                            how we tried to frame this, government users were
                            often disappointed that the platform wasn’t already
                            fully developed. Partners wanted to fund the end
                            product, not the development phase. We also wanted
                            to accelerate the development timeline, but this is
                            hard to do with only a handful of developers. Talent
                            Cloud found it difficult to secure resources for an
                            experimental project that cost more than a
                            department could fund on its own, but less than a
                            reasonable value for requesting a Memorandum to
                            Cabinet. Basically, we needed medium size money from
                            a stable source, and two years of experiment lead
                            time, and that’s not something the Government of
                            Canada innovation ecosystem is set up to easily
                            provide.

                        In April 2020, Talent Cloud launches the GC Reserve as a

                        launched with the "Timeline" feature. In April 2021, the

                        wraps up." style="width: 100%;"

                        <p>
                            Just as Talent Cloud was hitting its stride - with
                            the new applicant timeline ready to launch, multiple
                            hires emerging from single processes, and time to
                            staff way down - COVID-19 hit. Almost as though
                            someone had thrown a switch, Talent Cloud saw an
                            almost total shutdown of recruitment for externally
                            advertised term staffing on our platform.
                            Experiments became a nice-to-have as the entire
                            government shifted into response mode to meet
                            critical needs. The significance of the historical
                            moment wasn’t lost on the Talent Cloud team. In
                            mid-March 2020, the Government of Canada sent its
                            National Capital Region workers home for an
                            unprecedented period of extended mass telework. The
                            same day, Talent Cloud launched into repurposing its
                            site to deliver an internal mobility platform, which
                            went live three weeks later. The project was called
                            GC Reserve and lasted 4 months (see the write-up in
                            Section 5).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Talent Cloud faced funding issues in 2020-21, and
                            the team was forced to shrink. In November, the team
                            began writing up this report and preparing to
                            transition out. Then, just as the report was almost
                            complete, a handful of departments came forward
                            asking to post term jobs on the site. So Talent
                            Cloud rapidly dusted off the development work that
                            was set aside during the pandemic, and launched a
                            brand new application process, with an improved
                            design to promote diversity in hiring outcomes and
                            create a better screening experience for managers
                            and HR advisors. While we won’t get much chance to
                            gather a large sample size before our project
                            funding runs out at the end of March 2021, we have
                            four job advertisements running live on the platform
                            using the new model. And we’re happy to report that,
                            thus far, it’s doing what we’d hoped.
