                    Many staffing experiments in government begin with broad
                    goals, like reducing time to staff or improving diversity,
                    but few set concrete targets at the start of the project
                    against which all interventions and features are measured.
                    As a result, few of these experiments and initiatives
                    deliver the results they hope to achieve.
                </p>

                    Highlighting the value of targets and measurement is one of
                    the many valuable things the Results and Delivery work
                    championed by the Privy Council Office set out to address.
                    We heard them. We’ve built Results and Delivery not only
                    into how we measure our project’s performance, but also into
                    the design of the staffing process itself. (For more on
                    this, take a look at the Impact-Driven Staffing design our
                    team tested with managers.)

                    In the beginning, Talent Cloud set ambitious targets for
                    reducing time to staff and improving diversity and culture
                    fit. The first was measured in time, the second two were
                    measured in qualitative analysis. The first was intended to
                    deliver a new process; the second two were intended to
                    deliver a new methodology that would generate a different
                    outcome.

                <p>
                    Once set, we concretely tied these performance objectives
                    directly into the configuration and operations of the
                    platform itself. They were not seen as a separate
                    departmental responsibility. Instead, every form field,
                    every operation on the platform was questioned, user tested
                    and measured against its ability to advance these aims,
                    while complying with all applicable government policies and
                    requirements.

                    Dozens of experiments were run related to these performance
                    objectives on all elements of a staffing process that could
                    be influenced by Talent Cloud. This included components such
                    as the design of posters, the HR-to-Manager communication
                    relationship, applicant experience and online tools to help
                    with key tasks. (Notably, this did not include elements
                    residing exclusively with authorities outside the influence
                    of both partner departments and Talent Cloud, such as
                    language testing and security screening.) These experiments
                    never met the standard for a Randomized Control Trial - we
                    never had the volume of applicants to do this. So all the
                    results in this report should be read as signals rather than
                    as solutions. Nevertheless, the findings are encouraging,
                    and are consistent with private sector and academic research
                    findings.

                    When we started, it became rapidly apparent that no two HR
                    shops in government did things exactly the same way. Some
                    left managers largely to their own devices, while some ran a
                    full service staffing model. Some pushed pools as the
                    solution, while others expected managers to individually
                    staff positions with very specific merit criteria. Some
                    partners were under the Public Service Employment Act
                    (PSEA), while others had increased flexibility and different
                    processes altogether in key areas. Some departments even had
                    “universal criteria” for every job advertised in their
                    department, regardless of classification, and we carefully
                    built these requirements into the default settings for
                    specific departmental users to keep the process smooth and
                    service-oriented.

                    Because of this variety (which is never going to go away)
                    Talent Cloud was designed as a process that works for a wide
                    variety of HR cultures in small and large departments,
                    inside and outside the PSEA. This was the bar that was set
                    for all features, and something we tested against
                    rigorously. And not all tools are perfect in this regard -
                    many are still in the process of getting upgraded to the
                    model that came from live testing, where we did secondary
                    testing on the things that worked for some but not for
                    others. But in all cases, we found there was a way forward -
                    it just took time, meticulous attention to departmental
                    needs, and perseverance to get to a solution.

                    When departments take care of their own mandates, they
                    provide service to citizens that is adequate. When
                    departments collaborate, they provide service to citizens
                    that is better than adequate. But when departments invest in
                    the excellence of other departments, raising the quality of
                    the ecosystem as a whole, that is when they provide service
                    to Canadians that is truly exceptional. Because in doing so,
                    each team, each department, works to achieve more than it
                    could alone, and in turn is accelerated through the
                    knowledge and growth of other teams and departments.

                    Service components connect as teams connect. When each
                    department looks to the health and strength of the total
                    ecosystem as its primary goal, it is the ecosystem that
                    becomes high functioning and capable of greatness. And for
                    citizens, nothing less than a high-functioning ecosystem in
                    government will serve them well in the digital age.

                    So how does all this relate to Talent Cloud? Because the
                    problems associated with staffing touch more teams across
                    government than you can imagine. Talent Cloud was designed
                    as an experiment to accelerate the talent engine of
                    government, tackling problems at the heart of the ecosystem
                    as interlocking parts of the whole. We looked at the
                    totality of impacts, from the stress and time invested in
                    crafting a poster through to how a hire was doing after a
                    year on the job. We looked at manager procrastination
                    behaviours and IT security considerations in the
                    configuration of designs. We thought about what would waste
                    a single mom’s time on a Friday night, and what keeps a
                    Deputy Minister up on a Saturday night, thinking about unmet
                    skills gaps in the organization. We thought long and deeply
                    about who gets the job and why, and whether some of these
                    reasons needed a rethink if departments are really committed
                    to diversity and inclusion.

                    Talent Cloud’s progress against reducing time to staff and
                    improving diversity and culture fit in hiring is a direct
                    result of viewing technology, people, operations and policy
                    as part of a seamless ecosystem. All intended outcomes must
                    be successfully navigated across all barriers and throughout
                    all components.
