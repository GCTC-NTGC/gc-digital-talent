                    The Problem
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    In our user research, many applicants reported that they
                    found the official language requirements confusing in
                    government job advertisements. With the proficiency level
                    usually described as CBC or BBB, applicants who were new to
                    government had many challenges in understanding what was
                    required of them, and whether or not their level of language
                    ability would be sufficient to succeed in the job.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Managers also reported concerns with this element of the
                    screening process, expressing that applicants tended to
                    overestimate their bilingual capacity. This was resulting in
                    managers selecting promising applicants who didn’t end up
                    meeting the language requirement. As second language
                    evaluation (SLE) usually took place after a few candidates
                    had been shortlisted, when these candidates failed the SLE,
                    uncertainties and delays were created in the staffing
                    process. Managers sometimes had to go back to their
                    applicant pool several times, only to find that other top
                    applicants had already moved on to other offers.
                </p>

                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Those who do not meet the necessary language requirements
                    will not apply to bilingual positions if:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Applicants have clear understanding of the language
                        requirements, with guidance to cross-reference their
                        official language capacity to the Government of Canada’s
                        proficiency level structure; and
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Applicants with clearly insufficient language levels
                        will be dissuaded from applying if they understand that
                        they will absolutely not be appointed to the position if
                        they don’t meet the language requirement
                    </li>

                    The Experiment

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Talent Cloud initially identified two areas of intervention
                    related to official languages that could be easily added to
                    the platform design: changing the way information was
                    provided in a job advertisement and adding a nudge. These
                    were tested live with numerous Talent Cloud processes.
                    Talent Cloud tested these interventions with users in mock
                    processes, and then tested to see what would happen in live
                    processes.

                    Following the initial findings in 2019, Talent Cloud decided
                    to test a third intervention in 2020: adding a language
                    self-declaration form on the job application. This was
                    tested with users in mock processes, but has not yet been
                    released for testing on a live job advertisement.

                    On job advertisements, information about the language
                    requirements was rewritten in simple language and described
                    in a way that could be understood by applicants from various
                    backgrounds, including those completely new to government
                    jobs. A link to the Public Service Commission website on
                    second language evaluation was included for those interested
                    in learning more about the evaluation or taking the
                    self-assessment.

                    In order to discourage those who didn’t have the required
                    official language capacity from applying, a behavioural
                    nudge was added to the application process to ensure that
                    applicants fully understood that they would absolutely need
                    to meet the language requirements in order to be considered
                    for the position. Before they could submit their
                    application, applicants needed to tick a box confirming that
                    they had the required language capacity in order to proceed.

                    utilized information about applicants’ official language
                    capacity in real staffing processes, a new Official Language
                    declaration form was developed. Users had the option to
                    describe their official language capacity, while managers
                    could access the information in a way that supported them in
                    making staffing decisions (framed in the context of
                    Government of Canada language levels).

                    Of all the questions we received from applicant portal
                    users, which ranged from inquiries about specific job
                    advertisements to general technical questions, none was
                    related to the language requirements.

                    That said, there were still a few instances where applicants
                    over-estimated their language levels, despite the clearer
                    language on the job advertisement and the nudge against
                    overclaiming. In these cases, the applicants had some
                    ability in their second language, but didn’t have a
                    benchmark to understand how well this would translate to
                    Government language around CBC or BBB. This indicates the
                    need for the inclusion of further interventions.

                    The Official Language declaration form Talent Cloud designed
                    received positive feedback during user testing. It can
                    hopefully be integrated into use in the future, and tested
                    as a potential solution to the issue of misaligned applicant
                    self-assessment of language levels.

                    Talent Cloud users repeatedly reported that clarity of
                    information presented on job advertisement was an important
                    factor in motivating them to apply for opportunities. It was
                    important to ensure information was communicated in a way
                    that could be easily understood, especially for users who
                    had never previously applied to government jobs.

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    As language requirements are key information on government
                    job opportunities, Talent Cloud demonstrated that various
                    interventions can be implemented to ensure applicants
                    clearly understand what was required of them. These
                    interventions can also contribute to reducing time to staff
                    by helping deter potential applicants who do not have the
                    required official language capacity.
