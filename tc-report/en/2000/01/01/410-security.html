                    The Problem
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    The Security Clearance process was one of the most often
                    cited reasons for delays in the staffing process during our
                    user research. Though we anticipated most of these delays
                    happened for Secret clearance given the additional steps
                    involved, the same was reported for Reliability clearance as
                    well.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    We tried to better understand the process for Reliability
                    Clearance through reviewing the research done during
                    Blueprint 2020, as well as meetings with various
                    stakeholders. The Security Policy team at the Treasury Board
                    of Canada (TBS) helped us map out the typical clearance
                    process. We also interviewed the chief security officers at
                    a few of our partner departments. This research found that
                    similar to other steps in the staffing process, the security
                    clearance process varied widely across departments. These
                    interviews eventually led us to a meeting with the team at
                    the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who was responsible for
                    one of the checks in the Reliability Clearance process.

                        learned that due to the nature of the security clearance
                        process, an outside team like Talent Cloud couldn’t have
                        much influence in reducing timelines.</strong

                    The Hypotheses
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    While Talent Cloud couldn’t influence much when it came to
                    timelines related to security clearance, we could still help
                    clarify information in a user-friendly way. One of the
                    delays identified by experts in the process review involved
                    candidates who have lived outside of Canada for a certain
                    period of time. These candidates were required to request
                    and submit policy checks from those countries, which could
                    take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. Given most
                    candidates were not aware of this requirement until they had
                    been selected as the final candidate, Talent Cloud
                    hypothesized that in these cases, there was at least some
                    opportunity to accelerate the process.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>So here’s the hypothesis we landed on testing:</p>

                    Information about the security clearance process requirement
                    was provided to all potential applicants through the
                    website’s Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page, and later
                    on a thank you page after an application was submitted.
                    Potential applicants were advised to complete the security
                    forms in advance (but not to submit them until they were
                    asked to do so). They were also encouraged to request
                    out-of-country criminal record check ahead of time if they
                    had lived outside of Canada over a certain period of time.

                    The FAQ page has registered over 20,000 pageviews as of
                    March 2021 since we started tracking the statistics three
                    years ago. Though we could not measure directly how
                    information on the FAQ page might have influenced
                    behaviours, our interviews with people who were hired
                    through Talent Cloud indicated that they found the
                    information helpful. Some of them consulted the page
                    multiple times through the staffing process, even revisited
                    the page after they were hired.

                    We also heard from one manager that because his candidate
                    took the advice he saw on the thank you page, the candidate
                    immediately requested out-of-country criminal record checks
                    after submitting the application. As a result, the manager
                    estimated that the staffing process was shortened by two
                    weeks to a month.

                    Despite the minimum influence Talent Cloud had on the
                    security clearance process, sharing information with
                    applicants in advance has allowed them to be prepared and
                    helped to reduce time-to-staff in some cases. Sharing the
                    requirements in simple languages also helped applicants who
                    were new to government to better understand the process. We
                    even received requests from HR advisors at our partner
                    departments to share the information with their candidates.
