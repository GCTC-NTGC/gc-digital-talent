                    >
                    Speed is a critical factor in remaining competitive when the
                    talent being recruited has multiple opportunities to

                    During early workshops with applicants, Talent Cloud heard
                    that top talent responding to job advertisements would
                    potentially leave the competition if they were not contacted
                    within 2-3 weeks of submitting their application. This was
                    also true for each successive step after the initial
                    screening process (e.g. assessment/testing, interview,
                    reference check, final offer). Applicants expected no more
                    than a few weeks to pass between key stages, and no more
                    than 2 months overall from application to offer.

                    Workshop participants listed three top reasons for
                    withdrawing from job processes they had applied to
                    (government and other). These were:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        being offered another job that they had applied to
                        concurrently;
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        receiving a better offer from their current employer; or
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        interpreting the long wait as indicating something
                        undesirable about the work environment, manager or the
                        bureaucracy of the employer in general.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In all three cases, the slow speed of the average Government
                    of Canada staffing process would be a significant hindrance
                    to securing high performing talent, particularly if that
                    talent was motivated to find a new position and was applying
                    to multiple potential employers.

                    The hypothesis for this part of the research was fairly
                    simple: we thought top talent would drop out if processes
                    ran long. What we didn’t know was how quickly processes
                    would need to move in order to keep a sufficient number of
                    top applicants in the process to ensure that managers could
                    get an optimal hire (notably, one of their top choices of
                    applicants). We decided to test the self-reported claim from
                    workshop participants that processes needed to advance in no
                    more than 2-3 week intervals per stage, and that the total
                    process needed to take less than 2 months (at least until a
                    verbal offer was in place).

                    The Experiment

                    To test the impact of time to staff on the ability of
                    managers to retain applicants, we compared the percentage of
                    applicants who dropped out during the application screening
                    phase, while also tracking the speed at which the process
                    was moving forward.

                    While we observed that applicants dropout of hiring
                    processes at all phases, during this period nothing beyond
                    the application has been asked of the applicants. This helps
                    to avoid including unqualified candidates who drop out when
                    they see the assessment tools, such as a test.

                    For a small subset of the jobs advertised on the Talent
                    Cloud platform, the team conducted additional qualitative
                    analysis, tracking the manager’s top choices of applicants
                    at each stage, and following up with them about their
                    decisions and the impact of speed on their final decision to
                    accept or reject an offer.

                    The Results
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Data collected during the pilot confirmed what we heard from
                    applicants during our early workshops. When the applicant
                    screening phase took less than two weeks the average dropout
                    rate was 8%; when it was two weeks or more, the dropout rate
                    rose to 13%.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Talent Cloud then interviewed managers to see who, exactly,
                    was dropping out. Where possible, Talent Cloud also
                    contacted applicants to find out why they had withdrawn
                    their names. There was a consistent trend in the qualitative
                    research showing that high-performing applicants with other
                    offers on the table were the most likely to drop out of a
                    process that was moving more slowly. Unfortunately, in cases
                    where managers moved very slowly, sometimes they didn’t
                    realize for a month or two that their top choice of
                    applicant was already long gone. This caused a lot of
                    frustration for managers.

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Notably, this improved significantly in processes posted
                    more recently to the platform, when Talent Cloud had
                    released additional features, and was able to provide more
                    guidance about exactly how fast managers would need to move
                    in order to keep their top choices. In the most recent jobs
                    posted to the platform, managers were able to attract and
                    retain a significant amount of top talent, with 4-14 strong,
                    fully qualified applicants from an initial group of ~40-50
                    applicants. These processes averaged ~40 days from job
                    advertisement close to verbal offer (followed by time for
                    security clearance). Speed did indeed seem to help with
                    ensuring the Government of Canada was the first employer to
                    arrive with an attractive offer.

                    In workshops and interviews, applicants said that the need
                    for speedy processes applies at all stages. This indicates
                    that to keep top candidates in the applicant pool, managers
                    should move through screening, testing, interviews,
                    references, and finalization of offer in no more than three
                    week intervals. In our sample, just over half of dropouts
                    occurred during the initial screening phase, which could be
                    interpreted as applicants becoming more invested as the
                    process continues.

                    When processes moved more slowly, this often gave the
                    current employers of top applicants the chance to propose
                    and finalize promotions internally. A majority of top
                    applicants who declined positions (in our very small sample
                    size) did so to remain with their current employer. The
                    remainder were offered a position by another organization
                    sooner than the Government of Canada was able to finalize an
                    offer, and elected to take the firm offer that was before
                    them. In all but two cases, applicants confirmed that if the
                    Government of Canada had been the first to arrive with a
                    firm offer in writing, their decision would likely have gone
                    the other way. (In the remaining cases, the absence of a
                    manager profile on the job advertisement proved to be a
                    significant factor in the applicants’ final decision about
                    accepting an offer elsewhere, citing a mismatch with the
                    fit-to-team as influencing their decision.)

                    To make the Government of Canada more desirable to
                    high-performing talent with alternative employment
                    opportunities, the Government of Canada needs to have a
                    competitive time to staff - not just overall, but at each of
                    the many stages of screening and assessment. To determine
                    how fast exactly hiring managers must move, a larger
                    research study, with a larger sample size, would be
                    required.

                        After several failed staffing and contracting attempts
                        at finding rare talent for a specific role, a manager
                        came to Talent Cloud with a very specialized need. We
                        knew it was going to be tough to attract someone from
                        the private sector to join the Government for that role,
                        so we emphasized to the manager that speed would be an
                        essential component. The manager delivered a staffing
                        process that took less than six weeks to arrive at a
                        verbal offer, but even at this speed, it was almost not
                        fast enough. Here's a quote from the top applicant who
                        ended up securing the job.

                        the position I applied to... that was a long time to
                        wait and I assumed I wasn’t being considered. When I saw
                        an email from Talent Cloud in my inbox, I assumed it was
                        a ‘better luck next time’ note but was excited when I
                        read that I had made it to the second stage in the
                        hiring process.”

                    There are, however, things that hiring managers can do today
                    to make their position more attractive to candidates.
                    Keeping candidates in the loop during the hiring process,
                    even if it is to check in and let them know that things are
                    taking longer than hoped, may help managers retain their top
                    candidates throughout the hiring process. Developing
                    assessment plans in advance, and sticking to a screening
                    plan, can also be significant aids to keeping the hiring
                    process moving swiftly… and keeping high performing talent
                    engaged.
