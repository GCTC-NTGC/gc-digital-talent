                    The Problem
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Long timelines to staff can have several negative
                    consequences on hiring outcomes, including adversely
                    impacting the ability to attract high performing talent and
                    increasing the possibility that processes will be cancelled
                    due to shifting corporate priorities. Long staffing times
                    can also create extended vacancies in an organization to the
                    detriment of organizational performance.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    At the time when Talent Cloud first launched, it took 197
                    median days to staff an externally advertised position in
                    the Government of Canada. This number counts the time from
                    the job advertisement closes on GC Jobs to the first
                    occurrence of the employee in the pay system. It should be
                    noted that this figure includes aggregated data from both
                    indeterminate and term staffing. (Talent Cloud only
                    advertises term staffing positions, but the administrative
                    steps for staffing term and indeterminate positions are the
                    same.) This time to staff does not include lead up time for
                    managers and HR advisors, such as crafting the job
                    advertisement and securing approvals to staff.
                </p>

                    The Hypotheses
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Talent Cloud reasoned that if the time to staff could be
                    reduced, it would have positive impacts on the government’s
                    ability to attract high performing talent and be an asset to
                    managers needing to fill vacancies. But how long would the
                    time to staff need to be reduced by? Because there was no
                    clear data on what target we were aiming to hit, we decided
                    to make it as fast as we thought might be possible. Even if
                    we fell short, hopefully we’d be able to show progress
                    against the average time to staff.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Talent Cloud set an extremely ambitious target of reducing
                    time to staff to 30 days from the time a job advertisement
                    closed to the selection of the final candidate (this does
                    not include additional time for security clearance and/or
                    language testing). Notably, it also doesn’t include the time
                    managers and HR advisors put into getting to a live job
                    advertisement, but here we aimed to bring the time to staff
                    down to a few weeks at most (with the fastest time possible
                    being two days).
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    There was nothing magic about the 30 day target, it was just
                    a nice round number that seemed in line with private sector
                    industries. From an applicant’s perspective, one month to a
                    verbal offer, plus security clearance time, sounded
                    competitive and reasonable.

                    Early on, we laid out 20 points of intervention that we
                    thought had the potential to drive down the average number
                    of days it took to staff a position. These interventions
                    fell into three broad categories:

                        Behavioural nudges (to either address behaviour patterns
                        that were delaying time to staff or encourage new
                        behaviours that optimized results);
                    </li>

                        Business process re-engineering to move things along
                        faster; and

                    “Talent Cloud days” represent the number of days from the
                    time the job advertisement closed on our platform to the
                    time a verbal offer was given to the manager’s chosen
                    applicant, which covered the majority of Talent Cloud’s
                    platform interventions on reducing time to staff. Following
                    the verbal offer, a second count of days represents the time
                    for security clearance, language testing and HR
                    finalization, which Talent Cloud had little to no influence
                    over.
                </p>

                    While the time to complete security clearances remained
                    relatively stable throughout, the average time to staff (as
                    influenced by the platform) was reduced by more than 85 days
                    over the course of the pilot. The most recent staffing
                    processes on the platform took ~40 days from the close of
                    the job advertisement to final selection of the hire. This
                    is a significant reduction - a trend that we first began to
                    see with some jobs in the summer of 2019, and one that has
                    continued to grow with more recent postings.

                    It is also worth noting that these two most recent processes
                    were the first two to do the initial screening of
                    applications as they were received. (All previous processes
                    began screening applications once the job advertisement had
                    closed.) This effectively means that the clock for processes
                    is not only shorter, but can now be started sooner, which
                    has the potential to save another 1-3 weeks in the staffing
                    process.

                    When we looked at the way time to staff was reduced, we
                    noted another interesting finding. A closer look at the data
                    shows it’s clear that saying the average time went down to
                    ~40 Talent Cloud days in the last year doesn't tell the
                    whole story.

                    In fact, when we looked closely at the last 8 jobs
                    advertised on the platform, we realized we were seeing two
                    tracks developing: 4 processes that took longer and 4
                    processes that were much faster, showing us 2 distinct
                    patterns of behaviour on the platform. These trends
                    correlate directly with observations from Talent Cloud’s
                    live testing showing that those who followed the recommended
                    practices and used the tools on the site (as intended) saw a
                    faster trajectory. In essence,

                    One metric used to evaluate the speed of a hire is the time
                    from the interview to the letter of offer. In a 2017 study
                    by Glassdoor, Canada ranked 4th out of 25 countries surveyed
                    with an average time of 20.1 days,

                    The report also showed that, internationally, government is
                    also consistently the slowest industry to move from
                    interview to final hire, often taking 1 ½ - 2 months to
                    complete the hiring process post-interview.

                    Notably, the Government of Canada is competing with other
                    industries in the country in search of high-performing
                    talent. According to the 2019 Jobvite Recruiting Benchmark
                    Report, the Information Technology field (which has the most
                    overlap with positions listed on Talent Cloud),

                    to staff. It’s in line with the number of days it takes to
                    get to a verbal offer using the Talent Cloud platform,
                    although this is conditional on security screening and
                    language testing which then take an additional 1-2 months to
                    complete. This shows that the Government of Canada is likely
                    going to need to consistently bring time to staff down to
                    the timelines achieved by the Talent Cloud experiment, plus
                    additional time savings in the security clearance process
                    step, if it wants to be truly competitive with industry when
                    it comes to recruiting top performing digital and technology
