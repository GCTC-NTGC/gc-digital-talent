                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    On Talent Cloud our job advertisement builder does more than
                    create a document we can publish. The process of creating
                    the job advertisement itself is used to help managers put
                    together their thoughts about the job, and once drafted, the
                    advertisement serves as an important tool to start a
                    conversation with HR.

                    Managers have expressed to us the challenges of putting
                    together a job advertisement that properly translates their
                    needs into something that also appeals to applicants and
                    addresses the many requirements of Government HR. The job
                    application builder tool is our attempt at making this
                    process easy enough for anyone to finish, while ensuring HR
                    advisors aren’t shouldering a large part of the workload in
                    drafting content.

                    This tool combines our research on optimizing the
                    talent-to-team fit and reducing time to staff, helping
                    managers produce optimized job advertisements that will lead
                    to swift processes and strong hiring results, without
                    managers even having to think about the behind-the-scenes
                    research.

                    The job application builder is currently available for
                    managers to use and for HR advisors to review. The tool has
                    been used for dozens of job processes since its release, and
                    continues to be upgraded as new findings emerge.

                    Managers using the job advertisement builder are able to put
                    together job advertisements within a day or two (1-2 hours
                    of active drafting time). These drafts are generally
                    approved by their HR advisor with minimal changes, (although
                    any back and forth on editorial changes can take time.) In
                    our early workshops, managers reflected that this would
                    normally take weeks or even months of back-and-forth, so we
                    see this as a big improvement.

                <p>
                    The tool has also helped ensure that managers are made aware
                    of, and encouraged to apply (through nudges and choice
                    architecture), best practices that lead to better hiring
                    outcomes and faster staffing processes. This includes steps
                    to optimize the volume of applications (such as the number
                    of selection criteria) and details on the team culture,
                    operational requirements and work environment.

                    Applicants generally expressed a high level of satisfaction
                    with the job advertisements generated with our tool and have
                    highlighted the work environment and team culture sections
                    as being particularly valuable.

                    Early versions of the job advertisement builder worked well
                    in some areas, but also failed in a few unexpected ways.

                    One early blocker in 2018-19 was the sections for describing
                    team culture and work environment. Some managers didn’t know
                    where to start and found a blank text box daunting. It led
                    to procrastination and some told their HR advisors it was
                    too much work. To resolve this, Talent Cloud moved to
                    providing tools that pre-populated default text, based on a
                    checklist, which managers could then edit, making the task
                    much easier. Managers spend a lot of time editing as part of
                    their regular duties, so we redesigned the process to play
                    to this strength. This behavioural redesign resolved the
                    issue, and led to broader insights about procrastination
                    behaviours on the part of managers and steps Talent Cloud
                    could take to help address this.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Another challenge we observed in 2018-19 was that managers
                    on their own tended to add too many essential requirements
                    to a job advertisement. In the course of a year, a human on
                    the job uses a lot of different skills, and managers were
                    prone to try to list as many as they could imagine on a job
                    advertisement. To help managers arrive at an optimal number
                    of selection criteria - one that would attract the right
                    number of applicants and not be too long to process - Talent
                    Cloud built nudges into the tool to help managers realize
                    the detrimental impact of too many (or too few) selection
                    criteria.

                    Key Tasks
                </h4>

                    <li>
                        This is designed to help managers follow the logic flow
                        that begins with the Impact Statement. In order to
                        deliver the impact articulated, managers are asked to
                        identify a list of specific tasks the person hired will
                        be doing.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Key tasks are open text fields, but the number is
                        limited to 6, which proved to be the optimal number in
                        user testing (workshops and live testing). This was
                        chosen to strike a balance: on one hand, we wanted to
                        help managers provide key information applicants wanted
                        to see; on the other hand, we didn’t want managers to
                        overwhelm applicants with a huge list of tasks (which
                        generated negative behavioural associations with
                        micromanagement practices during early user testing).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Managers, when crafting key tasks, can draft as many as
                        they like. They can then move them up and down the list,
                        prioritizing and ordering their top six key tasks using
                        a sorting system. This also lets managers hold onto
                        draft content, in the event that HR advisors recommend
                        different key tasks.

                        This is designed to follow the logic flow from impact to
                        tasks to skills required to perform those tasks (and
                        ultimately deliver the impact on Canadians for which the
                        job is being filled).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A curated list of occupational skills is available to
                        choose from based on job classification, and a list of
                        transferable skills is available for all
                        classifications. This helps ensure consistent
                        descriptions and translations across different jobs
                        (paving the way towards interoperable talent pools for
                        those who pass requirements). This also makes it easier
                        for applicants to apply by allowing them to re-use work
                        done in previous applications that had the same skills
                        listed.

                    <li>
                        Skills are grouped into logical categories for ease of
                        browsing.

                    <li>
                        Managers can add a personalised description to each
                        skill if they feel a need to add further information or
                        they can use this space to let applicants know the
                        specific context in which the skill is applied on their
                        team.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Managers can also request new skills if none of the ones
                        provided meet their needs. (This information is gathered
                        through the tool, vetted through HR and added to the
                        master database for skills.)

                    <li>
                        Based on answers provided by the manager in the Work
                        Environment and Team Culture sections, skills are
                        suggested to the manager. (For example Resilience is
                        often suggested when the manager indicates the work
                        environment is high paced or relatively high stress;
                        Collaboration is recommended when managers indicate that
                        their team works with other teams regularly.)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        When the manager selects a skill, they are shown the
                        skill description and prompted for the level of
                        proficiency that is required.

                    <li>
                        Managers are strongly encouraged (through various
                        nudges) to keep the number of skills on their job
                        advertisement within an optimised range. (See Optimizing
