                <p>
                    The COVID-19 pandemic hit early in the third year of our
                    pilot and, when it did, staffing for the types of processes
                    our platform offered all but ground to a halt. As government
                    employees were sent home, we recognized a brand new
                    challenge was emerging. To respond to the pandemic, some
                    departments would need to scale up dramatically to meet
                    critical needs, creating talent gaps that could be filled by
                    employees in less critical roles.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Because we’re an agile team that embraces the digital
                    standards, we were able to pivot quickly and repurpose
                    Talent Cloud to create the GC Talent Reserve in just under
                    three weeks. This new portal was a dedicated, single-window
                    coordinated talent management tool for triaging digital and
                    tech talent needs across the Government of Canada. It
                    enabled the flow of talent from areas of lower priority to
                    areas of critical need, supported by data tracking and
                    central coordination.

                    Based on what we were hearing across our networks, and in
                    collaboration with the Community Management Office, the
                    policy side of the Talent Cloud team acted as central
                    coordinators, and drafted internal job advertisements (open
                    to employees with a valid security clearance) for in-demand
                    work streams, such as cybersecurity, MS Dynamics, software
                    development, system administration, and procurement. For
                    each work stream, volunteers were asked to put their names
                    forward at either a beginner, intermediate, or advanced
                    level.

                    Employees who wanted to volunteer were given clear criteria
                    to judge whether they should put forward an application.
                    Most importantly, we asked them to ensure their manager
                    would support a temporary placement if the applicant was
                    selected from the pool. The application form was short,
                    consisting of a few key questions that were assessed by the
                    central coordinating team. Applicants that passed the first
                    round were contacted by email to complete a follow-up
                    questionnaire and/or reference checks.

                    Managers who were experiencing a critical digital and tech
                    talent gap contacted the coordination team with a list of
                    the work stream and skills they required. In cases where
                    there were volunteers that had passed assessment, we
                    provided a list of applicants along with their profiles. We
                    also created additional streams of in-demand talent on GC
                    Talent Reserve for skills related to fields like procurement
                    when we received new requests. Once a manager selected an
                    employee, it is up to them to figure out an appropriately
                    fast and flexible HR arrangement to move the employee to
                    their department.

                    Barriers to Talent Mobility
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    As fast as the team moved to build GC Talent Reserve, we
                    weren’t fast enough. There was no way we could be, because
                    the tool that supports coordinated interdepartmental
                    functionality needed to be in place before the crisis hit.

                    GC Talent Reserve had several hundred employees submit their
                    names, and nearly three dozen employees with critical and
                    in-demand skills assessed and ready to be deployed. But
                    after that point, it was impossible for us to track whether
                    or not employees actually moved because the final connection
                    between managers and employees happened off our site. (In
                    one case, we actually heard about someone getting a new role
                    when she thanked Talent Cloud on Twitter for the GC Reserve
                    opportunity.) We also heard from managers that the paperwork
                    required for internal mobility, even at the secondment
                    level, was taking more time than they had, and many sought
                    talent already internal to their own departments to close
                    gaps more quickly.

                    Talent Cloud’s biggest takeaway from this was that until
                    there is a permanent, stable solution in the Government of
                    Canada capable of mapping, tracking, and incentivizing
                    employees to put their skills in a central profile or
                    interdepartmental talent repository, the Government won’t be
                    optimized to succeed the next time a significant, rapid
                    talent reallocation is required.

                        While we didn't run GC Talent Reserve for very long, we
                        built some interesting features for it that users found
                        valuable, which we’re now integrating back into the main
                        Talent Cloud platform. Notably, this includes automated
                        micro-reference checks for skills, enhanced sorting
                        functionality for managers and HR advisors in the
