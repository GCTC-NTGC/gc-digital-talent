                    The Problem
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Every externally advertised position in the Government of
                    Canada includes a list of selection criteria (or
                    requirements) which lay out the skills and experience an
                    applicant needs to demonstrate in order to be considered for
                    the position. These selection criteria fall into both
                    essential (required) and asset (nice to have).
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Getting the selection criteria right is critical to the
                    success of the staffing process. All applicants must be
                    assessed against each of the essential criteria, so adding
                    too many could lead to job competitions with many steps for
                    applicants to complete. On the other hand, the list of
                    essential criteria is also the first filter managers have to
                    keep unqualified people from applying. So too few essential
                    criteria and managers may find themselves with a very large
                    number of applicants, and an insufficient way to distinguish
                    who will be the best choice for the position. So the stakes
                    are pretty high for getting the selection criteria right.
                </p>

                    The Hypotheses
                </h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        There will be an optimal number of selection criteria in
                        terms of producing a hire.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        There will be an optimal number of selection criteria in
                        terms of reducing time to staff.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        More people will apply to job advertisements when there
                        are fewer essential criteria (or requirements).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Adding more essential criteria will increase the overall
                        time to staff.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Adding more selection criteria in total will increase
                        the overall time to staff.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        With the right interventions, managers can be guided to
                        adopt a targeted number of selection criteria (essential
                        and asset) for their job advertisements. We need to be
                        able to guide managers to use an optimal number of
                        essential criteria, or there will be no benefit from
                        uncovering it.

                    For all staffing competitions advertised on Talent Cloud we
                    kept track of key data including:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Number of essential criteria</li>

                    <li>Number of asset criteria</li>

                    <li>
                        Total number of selection criteria (essential + asset)
                    </li>

                    <li>Number of applicants</li>

                    <li>Number of assessments</li>

                    <li>Success of hiring process</li>

                    <li>Time to staff</li>

                    The correlations between these data points is what we are
                    interested in for testing our hypotheses. In addition, we
                    added a few different platform interventions to see if we
                    could influence the number of essential criteria managers
                    used.

                    We never blocked a job advertisement from going on the site
                    because of too many essential criteria. In fact, in the
                    first year of the live platform, we deliberately provided no
                    direct guidance to managers on how many selection criteria
                    to use, while we studied behaviours, choices, and outcomes.
                    (This caused a fair number of failed processes.)
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    After the first year, we added information for managers in
                    the instructions for the job advertisement tools, drawing on
                    the data from failed vs. successful job processes.

                    When we eventually launched our Job Advertisement Builder we
                    added some of these nudges into the platform. We knew it
                    would be tempting for managers to keep adding skills,
                    especially when they are only a click away, so we built in
                    real-time feedback to let managers know when they were
                    within the targeted number of essential skills. Based on the
                    behavioural sciences at the time, we went with numbers,
                    emojis and colour indicators (based on the standard
                    stoplight red-orange-green).

                    This was one of the most complex experiments to unpack what
                    we were seeing because of the number of factors involved.
                    Here’s what we think we’re seeing, but ultimately a much
                    larger study with a larger sample size will be required to
                    validate these findings:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There is an intersecting relationship between the number
                        of selection criteria (essential and asset), the number
                        of assessment steps, the length of each assessment step,
                        the number of applicants the job advertisement attracts,
                        the success rate of the hire, and the overall time to
                        staff.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Processes with fewer selection criteria attracted a
                        higher number of applicants. This increased the time to
                        staff at the initial screening stage of the hiring
                        process.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        As the number of selection criteria increased (essential
                        and asset), managers added additional assessment steps.
                        This increased the time to staff at the assessment stage
                        of the hiring process, and in the development time for
                        assessment materials. (We found, on average, each
                        essential criteria was assessed in at least two ways by
                        the hiring manager, and assets were assessed in 1-2
                        ways.)

                        We suspect that as the number of selection criteria
                        changes, factors impacting time to staff (volume of
                        applicants, number of assessment steps, manager energy
                        levels and enthusiasm) may counteract each other to
                        negate any time savings.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Processes with more than 8 essential criteria failed to
                        attract the number of applicants required to leave a
                        sufficient number of top applicants in the process after
                        the assessment stage. Effectively, it left a single top
                        applicant in the process, and if that person left, the
                        hiring process failed. (See diagrams on the hiring
                        funnel in Optimizing the Volume of Applications in this
                        section of the report.)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Processes with fewer than 4 essential criteria weren’t
                        tested on the platform. While it’s possible that 1-3
                        essential criteria may produce a strong hire, it’s
                        difficult to take into account the skill requirements
                        associated with a 5 factor match (hard and soft skills)
                        with fewer than 4 essential criteria. Based on the
                        selection criteria chosen by managers, we believe it
                        would not be possible to run an effective 5 factor match
                        with 3 or fewer essential criteria (although this might
                        be desirable for large generic pools of talent).

                            these factors, our recommendation for the optimal
                            range of essential criteria is 4-6, and no more than
                            8 selection criteria in total (essential + asset
                            combined).</strong
                        >
                        That means, if a manager wants a lot of essential
                        criteria, they will need to have few assets.

                    <li>
                        The number of asset criteria had no bearing on the
                        results. But the number of essential criteria mattered.
                        There appeared to be a range where the number of
                        essential criteria yielded more success. A manager with
                        5 essential criteria appeared to be as successful as a
                        manager with 6 or 7 essential criteria, as long as they
                        all had no more than 8 selection criteria in total.
                        (Managers with 4 essential criteria fared the best, but
                        the sample size was very small.)

                        We were successfully able to design platform
                        interventions that nudged managers to adopt these target
                        ranges for the number of selection criteria, which had a
                        positive impact on the overall results for hiring
                        outcome.

                        The presence of a guidance tool was applauded by
                        managers, as was the interactivity in terms of feedback
                        when they added or reduced the number of criteria. But
                        ultimately, they simply didn’t like having to work with
                        a tool that had smiley and sad faces. On the nudges
                        themselves, we conclude that the colours and the number
                        range are valuable, but next time we’d swap out the
                        emojis for something a little more subtle. (Of course,
                        then we’d have to test and see if it still worked…)

                    These findings represent weak signals, but they would likely
                    be worth pursuing with a larger study. In that context, it’s
                    important to point out that Talent Cloud uses selection
                    criteria made up of a single skill, whereas other platforms
                    sometimes use selection criteria made up of multi-component
                    experience requirements. This could impact an applicant’s
                    perception of whether or not a selection criteria was really
                    one requirement or several described together. Any future
                    study would need to take this into account.

                    Regardless of the results of the research on the optimal
                    number of selection criteria, we found that the inclusion of
                    nudges was surprisingly effective in changing manager
                    behaviour patterns. Our nudges combined numbers with
                    emotional and colour indicators, and were interactive, so as
                    the manager changed the number of essential and asset
                    criteria, the nudge was updated to reflect this change. The
                    usefulness of this addition to the platform could have
                    broader implications for changing manager behaviours in
                    other types of platforms as well.

                    criteria, HR advisors remain an invaluable resource for
                    managers.
