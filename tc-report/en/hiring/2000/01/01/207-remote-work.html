                    The Problem
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    The National Capital Region (NCR) accounts for only 4% of
                    Canada’s labour force, but 42% of the Federal Public Service
                    works there. The ability to hire employees to work outside
                    the location of the physical office is a policy flexibility
                    that has not been traditionally used. (Based on workshops
                    with managers and HR advisors, we suspect this was due to a
                    combination of managers not being encouraged to offer this
                    flexibility, and the GC Jobs system default forcing the
                    choice of specified location(s) of work based on government
                    office.)
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    While many departments also staff positions in regional
                    offices, “work from anywhere” was not a standard hiring
                    practice when Talent Cloud first launched this as a
                    platform-based staffing option in October 2018. (Notably, in
                    January 2021, the Public Service Commission adapted the GC
                    Jobs platform to include this option, largely in response to
                    the impact of COVID-19 on the federal workforce. It’s an
                    exciting development for workers across Canada.)

                    The Hypotheses
                </h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Talent is everywhere, and subsequently the talent
                        government needs is likely to be regionally distributed
                        across Canada, rather than occurring at a significantly
                        disproportionately higher per capita rate in the NCR;
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Allowing applications from employees across Canada
                        looking for a remote-work accessible position will
                        increase the chance of finding people with rare or in
                        demand skills;
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Managers who allow applications from remote workers will
                        see an increase in the number of high quality
                        applications;
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Given the choice of talent from remote and NCR
                        applications, managers will choose to hire remote
                        workers at least some of the time, resulting in greater
                        geographic diversity in Talent Cloud hires than in
                        standard “NCR only” or “regional office only” positions.
                    </li>

                    The Experiment
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    To promote remote accessible jobs, we engineered a hiring
                    model optimized to allow employees to work from anywhere.
                    The first step is to encourage managers to consider
                    accepting applications from people from outside their
                    geographic region.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Talent Cloud job advertisements tell applicants a lot more
                    about the job than they would see on a typical poster. This
                    includes information about ‘workplace environment’, such as
                    whether the position allows flex hours and whether it is
                    available for remote work.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    When managers build a job advertisement, the default
                    selection for remote work is that it is allowed. This is a
                    nudge that forces managers to intentionally exclude remote
                    workers and say that they only want to consider applications
                    from people in their geographic region. In a traditional job
                    process, the opposite has been true (where managers listed a
                    government office location for work, and would have to draft
                    additional text and justifications if remote work was
                    allowed). We make sure to give managers the definition of
                    what ‘remote work’ means right in the tool on the Manager
                    Portal for building job advertisements, and we provide
                    support to managers who choose to assess and/or hire remote
                    workers.

                        >
                        The first and most important intervention Talent Cloud
                        crafted in promoting remote work accessible jobs was
                        making this an option in the selection menu that
                        managers and HR advisors worked with while crafting a
                        job advertisement on the platform’s Job Poster Builder.
                        Up until this time, managers reported that even when
                        they wanted to offer remote work accessible positions,
                        corporate opposition and difficulties in posting led
                        them to back away from offering this option. When
                        managers learned it was simply available, many readily
                        adopted it without much persuasion.

                            >Make it the Default:</strong
                        >
                        In government, managers are trained to accept the
                        default. Managers reported that defaults meant corporate
                        direction had been set, and opting for something other
                        than the default not only required more work, but it
                        also felt vaguely non-compliant. In this case, we
                        reversed the trend that managers had been told for years
                        (avoid remote work) and made it the new normal (promote
                        remote work).

                    <li>
                        <strong
                            style="letter-spacing: -1px"

                            >Nudge to Keep the Default:</strong
                        >
                        Ideally, we would have the numbers to run a randomized
                        control trial to test different nudges and see how
                        different interventions stacked up to create the
                        strongest outcome. In this case, we simply added a line
                        (see screenshot below) that connected allowing remote
                        work to a higher quality of talent pool. While this was
                        a nudge based on our hypothesis and supported by
                        external research, it proved true. Those advertisements
                        allowing remote work drew better talent and had a higher
                        success rate in securing a top quality final hire. (This
                        is one of three flexibilities that hiring managers using
                        Talent Cloud were nudged to adopt. See the research
                        section on Flexibility Matters for insights on how these
                        flexibilities impacted the applicants’ decision to
                        apply. The “why” might surprise you - it surprised us.)

                        >
                        Job advertisements on Talent Cloud contained one of
                        these two phrases: “Remote Work Allowed” or “Remote Work
                        Not Allowed”. In user testing, several managers
                        expressed their discomfort with the clarity of this
                        language. (Notably, applicants reported that they really
                        appreciated the clarity.) Several managers requested
                        that we simply advertise when it was allowed, and be
                        vague about when it wasn’t. Talent Cloud declined to
                        make this change because part of the research
                        (qualitative and quantitative) was to determine if clear
                        allowance (or non-allowance) of remote work made a
                        difference to the application rates and final results.
                        Turns out it does… Quite a big difference, in fact.

                        In cases where managers allowed remote work they
                        received 63% more applicants than those that did not
                        allow remote work.

                        Only five Talent Cloud job posters failed to attract
                        qualified candidates, and four more saw the qualified

                        When presented with a candidate pool that included
                        remote applicants, more than half of managers selected a
                        remote worker as the hire, including some from small
                        communities. This indicates that there is a wide,

                    easy to forget that before the pandemic remote work was one
                    of the most desirable perks that an employer could offer,

                    By using a small nudge on the job poster builder, many
                    managers were persuaded to change long-held behaviours and
                    chose to accept applications from remote workers. This gave
                    them access to more talent and made it more likely that they
                    would make a hire.

                    Government is a huge employer. If this model was permanently
                    applied across GC hiring, it could be a high value social
                    impact at scale and pave the way towards regionally
                    representative diversity in government employment. At the
                    community level, this could aid in accelerating distributed
                    economic recovery, and improve the quality of the Public
                    Service’s talent base.

                    While the Talent Cloud experiment yielded promising signals,
                    it’s still very small in scale. We’re hopeful there will be
                    larger scale research from other GC HR authorities on the
                    impact of the 2021 change to the GC Jobs platform allowing
                    remote work. We look forward to comparing notes and
                    findings.
