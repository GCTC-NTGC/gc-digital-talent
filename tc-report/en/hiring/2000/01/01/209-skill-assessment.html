                    The Problem
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    One of the goals of the job advertisement and job
                    application process is to make it evident to potential
                    applicants whether or not they are qualified. Ideally, only
                    those who are qualified will apply for the job. But the
                    reality is that in most Government of Canada application
                    processes, there are a significant number of people who
                    apply and are not deemed qualified, even at the initial
                    screening phase of the process. Screening applicants who
                    aren’t qualified contributes to the length of time managers
                    spend on a staffing process.
                </p>

                    The Hypotheses
                </h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Not everyone who applies will be qualified, and some
                        applicants knowingly stretch the truth to get their
                        application seen by a hiring manager.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Rather than stretch the truth, some applicants would
                        prefer to (more accurately) describe themselves as not
                        meeting the required skill proficiency levels, as long
                        as the manager will still get a chance to review the
                        application they submit.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Separating out these applicants would save managers time
                        because they could skip this group if very large numbers
                        of applications were received.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Some of these applicants may be incorrect in their own
                        self-assessment, and might actually be qualified for the
                        job.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Managers would prefer to screen an applicant pool where
                        a higher percentage of applicants proved to be fully
                        qualified.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    Talent Cloud decided to include an active step in the
                    application process, where applicants had to self-assess and
                    indicate their level of skill proficiency for each skill.
                    Our thinking was that this active step would reduce the
                    number of people who falsely claimed they had the required
                    skill proficiency. However, we were worried that this could
                    bias the pool of applicants by disproportionately affecting
                    equity-seeking groups who might be more likely to
                    self-assess below the required level.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    For this reason, we decided to accept all applications
                    regardless of the skill level the applicant indicated. It’s
                    common practice in web forms to block the submission of
                    applications until the user has indicated they meet all
                    requirements. In this case, we made the deliberate decision
                    not to force candidates to claim that they had the required
                    levels just to submit their application.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    This effectively created a new group of applicants that we
                    separated out for managers before they started their review
                    (as part of the sorting in the Applicant Tracking System
                    developed by Talent Cloud on the Manager Portal). This new
                    group could be skipped by managers when many applications
                    were received, but could also be used to explore our
                    hypothesis that some applicants would incorrectly
                    self-assess, and should in fact be considered for the job.
                    If managers regularly thought the candidates had under-rated
                    their skills (and were in fact well qualified), then it
                    would be plausible that this step was introducing
                    undesirable outcomes, and we would need to investigate
                    further.

                        proficiency level, we had to describe what those levels
                        were. For an initial test, we separated skills into hard
                        skills (technical and occupational) and soft skills
                        (behavioural and transferable) and described levels of
                        proficiency for each. For hard skills, increasing levels
                        of proficiency meant you were able to complete tasks of
                        increasing difficulty with decreasing levels of
                        supervision or support. For soft skills, however, we
                        wanted a separate scale. You don’t have “advanced
                        resilience” as a soft skill. Instead, resilience is
                        something you have to demonstrate over a long period of
                        time in various situations. So for soft skills, our
                        increasing levels of proficiency meant you had
                        demonstrated the skill with increasing consistency,
                        under increasingly difficult or stressful situations.

                    Roughly 15% of all applicants (155 out of 1004) indicated
                    that at least one of their skill levels were below the

                    where managers reviewed these applicants (and Talent Cloud
                    was able to follow up with them), the manager was in
                    agreement that applicants didn’t meet the required skill
                    level, and those applicants were not invited for further
                    testing.

                    Several applicants interviewed who did indicate lower skills
                    levels shared that they knew they did not meet the
                    requirements, but wanted the manager to see their
                    application anyway. This indicates that, at least in those
                    cases, the applicants were not accidentally submitting
                    erroneous data, and that the platform intervention was
                    functioning as designed.That said, the addition of this
                    requirement in the application process also created an
                    additional step for applicants - one that caused some to
                    delay submission of their applications due to uncertainty
                    over the skill level they should self-select. Applicants
                    reported that they were often unsure of their level, and
                    this led to procrastination in submitting the application.
                    (And of course, we can’t see who didn’t end up applying

                    Given the constraints on the data Talent Cloud was permitted
                    to collect on the platform, we weren’t able to
                    cross-reference quantitative Employment Equity data with
                    applications submitted claiming a lower level of skill
                    proficiency than the job required. In order to correct for
                    this absence of data, the team ran a deeper qualitative
                    analysis of applicants for a small number of processes run
                    on the platform. While the sample size was small and results
                    are definitely inconclusive, there was no overt trend on the
                    platform towards equity-seeking groups being more likely to
                    self-assess at a lower level.

                    (Further study would be required to confirm this finding,
                    and to look into whether or not the bias-reduction design in
                    the skills model was a factor in ensuring that
                    equity-seeking groups weren’t over-represented in
                    self-assessing at a lower skill level. Our platform values

                    there could be a potential connection to the way in which

                <p>
                    On the surface, a 10-15% reduction in the applicants to
                    screen would seem to be helpful to managers. But this is
                    only part of the story. Of the remaining applicants, roughly
                    half were eliminated by hiring managers at the initial
                    screening, indicating that a majority of applicants were
                    still overestimating their skill level. Because of time
                    savings and other volume management components on the Talent
                    Cloud platform, managers estimated that this 10-15%
                    reduction in applications only saved 1-2 hours of time in
                    the initial screening phase. Applicants, on the other hand,
                    expressed that in some cases this element of the application
                    process created uncertainty and anxiety about accuracy in
                    self-reporting, and delayed the submission of applications.

                    While there may be many cases where self-assessment is a
                    useful tool in advancing the applicant selection process,
                    Talent Cloud didn’t find that it was as useful a component
                    in the initial application phase as we had hoped it would
                    be. This held true for both hard (occupational) and soft
                    (behavioural) skills.

                    As a result, this component of the application design didn’t
                    make it into the massive overhaul of the application process
                    (called Timeline) the team released in 2021. (For more on
                    the new model, take a look at Skills Instead of Experience
                    in Research Section 3.) Instead, we’re moving more in the
                    direction of helping improve the three-way conversation
                    between managers, applicants and HR advisors around what
                    “qualified” looks like for a given skill, and what
                    information applicants need to provide to help managers make
                    screening decisions that value diverse life paths for
                    acquiring and demonstrating skills.
