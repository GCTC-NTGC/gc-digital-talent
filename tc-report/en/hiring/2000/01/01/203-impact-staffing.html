                    The Problem
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    The Government of Canada’s HR system currently operates on a
                    classification-based staffing model. The logic of this model
                    is that departments have mandates, and they establish a
                    hierarchy to support outcomes related to this mandate. Jobs
                    are classified and fixed into the hierarchy with generic
                    work descriptions (or in rare cases, specialized work
                    descriptions). Managers fill “boxes” or vacant positions in
                    the organizational chart of their unit, using the
                    classification of the position and its work description to
                    identify the experience required.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    This standard GC approach is optimized for a workforce that
                    is predominantly indeterminate. It’s not optimized to serve
                    the recruitment of talent for project-based positions where
                    specific skill sets are required and the intended outcome of
                    the position is time-limited.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    At the time Talent Cloud first launched its live platform in
                    2018, impact statements and the inclusion of key tasks were
                    rarely included in GC job advertisements - both of which
                    appeal to applicants on the hunt for a new position.
                    (Although in 2019 and 2020, we started to notice a few job
                    advertisements on the GC Jobs site including this
                    information.) Our early workshop findings indicated that the
                    inclusion of impact statements and key tasks in a job
                    advertisement would be a benefit in attracting
                    high-performing talent, but how would managers be trained to
                    develop a completely different type of job advertisement?
                    And would HR advisors support the new direction?
                </p>

                    The Hypotheses
                </h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The inclusion of an impact statement and key tasks in a
                        job advertisement would help attract high-performing
                        talent.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Managers were used to crafting job advertisements in a
                        particular way. In order to get them to successfully
                        craft a new type of job advertisement, a new type of
                        workflow for crafting that advertisement would need to
                        be developed.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        In order for managers to adopt the new behaviour
                        pattern, the tools would need to present both a logical
                        flow and be easy to work with.

                    Talent Cloud explored the idea that the same logic model
                    supporting departmental structures could be used, in
                    microcosm, to help managers identify the impact individual
                    applicants would have on Canadians. At a grand scale,
                    departments have a mandate, and from this mandate flows
                    intended outcomes. The hierarchy and job classification
                    structure is then organized around delivering these
                    outcomes.

                        one of the workshops, a manager said she couldn’t
                        actually articulate the impact of the hire she had
                        planned - filling a standard vacancy she had never
                        questioned needed filling. She said she was going to go
                        back to her management team for a discussion about
                        rethinking their upcoming staffing needs, with a new
                        focus on aligning the hiring plan with results and
                        delivery.

                    To understand how managers and applicants would engage with
                    the proposed model, Talent Cloud held a series of workshops
                    in the summer and fall of 2017 where managers went through a
                    paper exercise for both imagined and real job processes they
                    had planned to test a new model for crafting job
                    advertisements.
                </p>

                    Managers were first asked to identify the intended impact on
                    Canadians from the hire they intended to make. We then
                    walked them through an exercise to articulate and prioritize
                    what key tasks would be required to deliver this impact.
                    Once the key tasks were identified, we asked them to
                    articulate what skills would be required for an employee to
                    succeed in delivering each key task. These skills were then
                    summarized and prioritized, and formed the basis of a new
                    way to arrive at the essential and asset criteria for a GC
                    job advertisement.

                <p>
                    In the workshops, we tested to see whether managers could
                    complete the task with minimal instructions, and we tested
                    to see if what they produced made sense to HR advisors.
                </p>

                    Following the successful workshop testing of the new logic
                    flow, our team created an MS word document which was used by
                    managers to craft job advertisements for live job processes
                    advertised on the platform in the fall and winter of 2018.
                    Refinements were made, and the new process was programmed
                    and became part of the Job Advertisement Builder Tool on the
                    Manager Portal (see the write-up on this in Section 4 of the
                    report.) Managers were interviewed about their impressions
                    of the logic flow and the tools, and reported favourable
                    impressions of the approach.

                    Talent Cloud also tested the flow of the job advertisement
                    with applicants, interviewing people about their impressions
                    of the usefulness and flow of information provided.

                    Managers reported that they found the new approach easy to
                    use. This redesign of the job advertisement allowed managers
                    to craft a high quality job advertisement in 1-2 hours.
                    Notably, this was true for both seasoned managers who had
                    learned the standard GC approach for drafting job
                    advertisements, and new managers who had never staffed in
                    government. This showed that not only could the new logic
                    flow be used to change the approach of seasoned managers, it
                    could also be adopted easily by new users.

                    the new process met the approval of HR advisors. Talent
                    Cloud job posters were routinely approved with very little

                    One of the most interesting findings related to this
                    platform intervention was the way in which managers were
                    able to dramatically change their behaviours, easily
                    adapting to a new workflow for producing a job
                    advertisement.

                    Talent Cloud crafted this new process flow to better
                    optimize job advertisements for project-based work, but
                    there’s no reason that it couldn’t also be used for any job
                    advertisement in the Government of Canada. While Talent
                    Cloud’s platform automates nudges related to optimizing the
                    number of key tasks and skills on a job advertisement,
                    there’s no reason these lessons learned couldn’t be manually
                    adapted by any manager on any platform looking to craft a
                    new type of job advertisement. (That said, to promote a
                    consistent change in manager behaviours and job
                    advertisement content, Talent Cloud found that standardized
                    and automated platform solutions were an important component
                    in delivering results.)
