                    The Problem
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Many of the managers in Talent Cloud’s early workshops in
                    2017 reported that the hires they had secured through pool
                    staffing processes in previous years had proved to be poor
                    fits in the long run. This had led to frustration, further
                    staffing gaps, and time and effort wasted.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Several managers mentioned in these same workshops that
                    their preferred staffing process was through “internal
                    networking” (basically, poaching talent from other
                    departments using personal networks). Managers reported that
                    this practice was common among peers. Significantly, it
                    wasn’t their preferred staffing method only because it was
                    faster. It also allowed managers to get insights (before
                    committing to a hire) about the soft skills and culture fit
                    side of recruitment that was hard to come by otherwise.
                    However, hiring managers and GC senior management who
                    participated in interviews reported that the practice of
                    internal poaching was unsustainable and harmful in large
                    numbers; it was creating internal instability in teams
                    requiring high-demand skills, and was failing to refresh the
                    GC talent pool. This was particularly acute in digital
                    talent and, ironically, HR related positions.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    External applicants in workshops in 2017 reported
                    frustration with applying for jobs where they knew nothing
                    about the work environment or team they might be joining,
                    and the absence of this information was a deterrent for
                    highly qualified applicants with multiple employment
                    choices. GC employee workshop participants who had
                    previously been recruited to a team where the fit proved to
                    be poor reported that they swiftly moved on to other
                    positions (or intended to move on in the near future).

                    The Hypotheses

                    <li>
                        Humans hire humans. This means that the person each
                        manager or applicant is in a process matters to both the
                        initial hiring decision and the longevity of the success
                        of the hiring fit. It’s not an accurate representation
                        of the hiring process for a staffing model to be based
                        on the assumption that a neutral widget hires another
                        widget to fill an organizational gap with a specific set
                        of criteria, without any behavioural, cultural,
                        historical or ecosystem considerations in play.

                        By changing the information on the hiring poster to
                        account for human factors, we can improve the
                        optimization of the talent-to-team match for both the
                        initial hiring result and longer term outcomes, such as
                        retention rates and performance on the job.

                    <li>
                        By democratizing access to information (giving
                        applicants more internal information about the
                        organization than they normally get), more applicants
                        who are a poor fit will self-select out of the process,
                        leading to a higher overall quality of applicant pool
                        for managers to choose from.

                    <li>
                        If managers factor human elements into the essential and
                        asset requirements of the job itself, the final hiring
                        selection will be more likely to result in a hire who
                        can succeed in the role (not only doing the tasks of the
                        job, but also working well with team members in a
                        broader organizational context.)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Factoring culture fit elements into the hiring process
                        will function as a form of “pre-boarding”, acting to
                        accelerate the onboarding success of new hires long
                        before the moment when the new hire actually starts in
                        the job.

                    - one that we had to not only be aware of, but also actively
                    work to guard against. When staffing processes strengthen
                    culture fit, there is also the potential for a model that
                    facilitates the “like hires like” scenario, which
                    exacerbates gaps in inclusion and diversity, and works
                    against equity-seeking groups. Awareness of this risk led
                    the team to develop bias reduction elements, working in
                    tandem with elements designed to optimize the talent-to-team
                    match. (See Research Section 3 on the team’s diversity and
                    inclusion theory and designs.)

                    The Experiment
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    To begin, Talent Cloud needed to first identify which “human
                    elements” to choose to test in a new type of GC job
                    advertisement. The team held a series of workshops in 2017
                    to identify promising elements.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Taking the top 10 components of a job advertisement that
                    recurred most often in workshops, Talent Cloud then
                    conducted a survey (as a subset of other workshops) with
                    internal and external applicants in 2017-18. This was a
                    simple form that asked people to rank the order of
                    importance for information on the job advertisement. The top
                    three factors in our research were key tasks of the job,
                    team culture, and impact.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Because Talent Cloud was already separately working on
                    testing the intersection of key tasks, impact, and skills
                    required (see Impact-Driven Staffing in this research
                    section), we expanded on the concept of team culture. In the
                    end,
                    <strong
                        style="letter-spacing: -1px"
                        data-h2-font-weight="b(800)"
                        data-h2-font-color="b(purple)"
                        >Talent Cloud elected to add manager profile, team
                        culture and work environment to the job

                    >.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Talent Cloud tested these elements in live job processes,
                    and interviewed applicants about the influence of these
                    factors on their decision to apply.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Talent Cloud realized that if the information about “human
                    elements” was to influence the hiring outcome, it needed to
                    also factor into the screening criteria at the heart of the
                    hiring process. Otherwise, the new information being shared
                    might influence an applicant’s decision to apply, but it
                    would fail to shape the other half of the equation: how
                    managers decide on their final hire.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    In order to connect the three human factors (team culture,
                    manager leadership style and work environment) to the
                    selection criteria, Talent Cloud tested the correlation
                    between different workplaces and behaviours that were
                    successful in different contexts. Talent Cloud ran a series
                    of workshops in 2018 with managers, asking them to identify
                    “the good, the bad and the ugly” when it came to GC
                    workplaces, and then to work together to identify who
                    succeeded in each of these environments. The results
                    produced a “map” of sorts that Talent Cloud then used to
                    design a semi-automated tool for managers in selecting
                    essential and asset criteria for the job advertisement.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    For example, if in their checklist on the manager’s job
                    advertisement tool, managers identified that a workplace was
                    high stress, resilience would be suggested to them as a soft
                    skill to add to the job poster. This wasn’t so much
                    behavioural psychology as it was an exercise in giving
                    individual managers the benefit of collective advice from
                    their peers. Managers made the final decision on whether or
                    not to include the suggested soft skills. Managers were also
                    given draft text by the tool (based on what elements of the
                    work environment they selected) to help them craft a work
                    environment statement for the job advertisement. (We found
                    that managers procrastinated with this task significantly -
                    blank text boxes on culture were daunting - until we gave
                    them some rough text to start with. Managers love to edit -
                    it’s what they’re trained for. This resolved the
                    procrastination issue and automated the acceleration towards
                    stronger, faster job advertisement drafts for HR advisors to
                    review.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Following the mapping exercise in 2018, and live testing in
                    2018-19, Talent Cloud revalidated and refined the insights
                    by repeating the exercise in 2019, as part of refining its
                    taxonomy for transferable skills. A fuller automation of
                    this work has been designed and is in early testing stages.

                    We also did follow-up interviews with managers 1-2 years
                    after their initial hire to find out how the fit went, and
                    what the long-term impact of the hiring approach had been
                    for overall successful work delivery and government fit. The
                    results were impressive. We were able to interview 55% of
                    our hiring managers, many of whom had made multiple hires
                    through the platform. Retention rates for the recruited
                    talent were enormously high at 94% still in the Government
                    of Canada 1-2 years after the initial term hire (bearing in
                    mind that the initial term positions were for 6 months - 1
                    year). 77% of these hires were still on the same team, and
                    many had already had a term extension or conversion into an
                    indeterminate position. In all but one case, managers
                    reported that they were happy with the hiring fit, and would
                    repeat the approach.

                    Perhaps more importantly, managers reported that they
                    thought the culture fit was strong and liked working with
                    the employees hired. The applicants hired that we were able
                    to interview reported the same thing, expressing fondness
                    and loyalty to the team, and a strong culture fit. The
                    hiring approach produced both productivity and happiness,
                    which are workplace outcomes worth having. (See also Case
                    Study: Manager and Applicant Interviews in Section 2 of this

                    One of the important things to note is that while there are
                    certain leadership values that are consistently important
                    (see Why Flexibility and Authenticity Matter in this
                    report), there is significant diversity when it comes to
                    successful organizational cultures. This is often dependent
                    on the size of the organization, their mandate or product,
                    and what they offer in terms of a value proposition to
                    customers and employees. In this context,

                    The effort to optimize the hiring fit between applicants and
                    teams has led to numerous elements on the Talent Cloud
                    platform, large and small.

                    For us, our approach says that a strong fit between an
                    incoming individual and their team is critical to successful
                    work delivery. To account for this, systems and process
                    design should approach actors in the system as humans, with
                    emotions, work styles, preferences and lives beyond their
                    jobs… and the fit between these humans will be as important
                    as the skills each possesses individually. This base
                    assumption has led to a platform that is radically different
                    in feature design and operations than the standard GC hiring
                    approach.

                    While there are ways to achieve this success through various
                    features and design choices, systems that wish to optimize
                    the talent-to-team match will need to extensively user test
                    their choices, and should strongly consider including a
                    focus on work environment, team culture and manager
                    leadership style.

                    <p data-h2-font-color="b(red)">
                        Talent Cloud introduced profiles for both managers and
                        applicants. These profiles were voluntary. We wanted to
                        see how they would get used and if they added value to
                        the platform.
                    </p>

                    <p data-h2-font-color="b(red)">
                        Interestingly, applicants reported that the presence of
                        an authentic manager profile was extremely important to
                        them in the application process, even if the profile was
                        relatively brief. In the only two cases where a Talent
                        Cloud hiring manager declined to provide a profile, the
                        final qualified candidates accepted other positions
                        after the interview phase, resulting in no hire being
                        made. While this could also be a coincidence, we think
                        not. We had an instance where a manager with a profile
                        and a manager without a profile posting almost identical
                        jobs in the same period. The manager with the profile
                        received almost twice as many applications, and had
                        twice as many qualified candidates after the interview
                        stage, leading to multiple hires.

                        On the other hand, when it came to applicant profiles,
                        managers reported almost never referring to them.
                        Instead, they focused their screening efforts on the
                        application itself. This showcased the importance of
                        applicants understanding the need to include details
                        about how they came to earn their skills in the
                        application itself, and factored significantly into the
                        Timeline design Talent Cloud released in early 2021.
