                <p>
                    Back in 2017, before we launched the Talent Cloud staffing
                    platform, we put together a list of 20 assumptions that we
                    had about time to staff that we wanted to test. These were
                    areas where workshops indicated there might be ways to save
                    some time. While not everything we tested was useful (and
                    there were a few hypotheses we didn’t get a chance to test),
                    here’s the list of what proved valuable in reducing time to
                    staff in our experiments.

                        >
                        Working with the Public Service Commission, Talent Cloud
                        was able to consistently reduce the time to staff
                        required for this step to zero days by developing an
                        integrated priority screening process that ran
                        concurrently with other steps in hiring on the platform.
                        Managers reported that this saved them approximately a
                        month in their usual timeline. (For a full write-up, see
                        Integrated Priority Screening in this section of the
                        report.)

                        Talent Cloud worked to reduce the volume of mis-matched
                        applications by giving applicants more information about
                        the job. By democratizing access to this information,
                        Talent Cloud gave applicants more responsibility for
                        deciding whether they thought they would be a “fit” for
                        the job, reducing screening burden on managers and
                        improving applicant experience. (For a full write up see

                        Talent Cloud provided hiring managers with an online
                        tool to create a custom assessment plan that was
                        pre-populated with the essential and asset criteria in
                        the job advertisement. This provided a single place to
                        develop questions, attach assessments to skills, and
                        write the rating guide. Managers and HR advisors could
                        both edit the plan, and rearrange information according
                        to their preference. For example, managers usually liked
                        things arranged chronologically, so they could plan
                        their calendars around upcoming steps, whereas HR
                        advisors preferred to organize information by essential
                        and asset skills, and their corresponding assessment
                        method(s). We estimate that this tool (and the nudges in
                        it) reduced time to staff by approximately 2-6 weeks.

                        >
                        In mid-2020, Talent Cloud released a feature that allows
                        managers to begin assessing their candidates once the
                        advertisement goes live. The early results suggest this
                        could reduce time to staff by anywhere from 2 weeks to
                        several months, as managers reported higher enthusiasm
                        levels for sorting applicants as they came in, reducing
                        procrastination. Managers felt that evaluating a handful
                        of applications a day was much more manageable than
                        receiving them all at once, and they were excited to see
                        who had applied each day. This speed in the initial
                        screening phase also helped managers to retain top
                        talent by making their initial contact with high quality
                        candidates more quickly.

                        On Talent Cloud, managers are able to view applications
                        directly on the Applicant Screening Tool, and found
                        their applicant pool pre-sorted into veterans and
                        priorities, Canadians, non-Canadians and those applying
                        with skills below the required level. Both managers and
                        HR advisors are also able to sort and comment on
                        applications (each through their own portal), reducing
                        email-based conversations by introducing a central
                        platform (which also tracks time). We estimate that the
                        introduction of this tool was able to reduce the time to
                        staff by 2-4 weeks (See A Tool for Applicant Tracking in

                        and encouraged managers to target this. This resulted in
                        a more focused assessment plan that took less time to
                        complete, and contributed to managing the volume of
                        applications. (For a full write up see Optimizing the

                        >
                        Reference checks often get tagged on to the end of a
                        hiring process and can take days to complete. Talent
                        Cloud gave candidates the option to provide
                        “micro-reference checks” as evidence to substantiate
                        their claims during the application process.
                        Micro-reference checks were only used a handful of
                        times. We still see potential to reduce time to staff by
                        up to a week, but this will require further work with HR
                        advisors to develop tools that they feel confident are
                        as valuable and rigorous as traditional reference
                        checks.

                        >
                        We identified supplementary information needed for later
                        steps in the staffing process that could delay the
                        employee's start date, and provided nudges to encourage
                        candidates to start gathering this information earlier
                        on. This included encouraging applicants to fill out
                        their security screening forms and have them ready, and
                        request out-of-country police checks early on.
                        Applicants were also prompted to have copies of things
                        like their education credentials ready. Qualitative data
                        showed employees that started collecting this
                        information after submitting their application reduced
                        time to staff by 1-2 weeks, but this is a very limited
                        sample size.
