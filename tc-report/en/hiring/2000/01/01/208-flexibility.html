                    The Problem
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    When we started this experiment in 2017, the Government of
                    Canada only supported flex hours, telework and remote work
                    accessible jobs in rare cases, and these flexibilities
                    weren’t included on job advertisements. We didn’t even know
                    if this was a problem, but it seemed inefficient to recruit
                    people who might potentially need these flexibilities to
                    jobs that didn’t allow them. We wanted to know if a problem
                    even existed, and if it did, whether or not it was impacting
                    application rates and quality-of-fit.
                </p>

                <!-- Titles -->
                <h3
                    data-h2-font-weight="b(800)"
                    data-h2-font-size="b(h3)"
                    data-h2-margin="b(top, xl) b(bottom, s)"
                    style="letter-spacing: -1px"
                >
                    The Hypotheses
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    We had a theory that a number of things that weren’t
                    currently on a standard Government of Canada job
                    advertisement might actually have a big influence on
                    attracting high performing talent to apply. We also thought
                    some of this information might help applicants self-select
                    as a good/poor fit for the job and the team. So we set about
                    trying to get a better understanding of what those things
                    might be, and whether or not they mattered.
                </p>

                    The Experiment
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    In 2017, Talent Cloud ran an experiment where we attempted
                    to identify what types of statements might influence an
                    applicant’s decision to apply. We built a list of ~60
                    sentences or sentence fragments. These were drawn from
                    various components of the draft job advertisement design we
                    were testing, including job impact, manager profiles, work
                    environment, types of technologies used, workplace
                    amenities, team culture, operating context and details such
                    as whether or not flexible work and remote work were
                    permitted.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    In a series of workshops, we asked applicants to
                    individually sort statements into piles according to:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Things that would make me want to apply for a job I
                        wasn’t interested in
                    </li>

                    The workshops were framed this way to map what types of
                    information and statements would alter the decisions of the
                    applicants. We didn’t just want to know what they liked or
                    disliked - we wanted to know what would change their
                    behaviour patterns.

                    Following the sorting of statements by each individual
                    participant, we asked them to compare their decisions in a
                    facilitated discussion. Some patterns became immediately
                    apparent, but there were two in particular that surprised
                    us.

                    Universally, across the workshops, applicants placed
                    “flexible hours allowed”, “telework allowed” and “work from
                    anywhere” into the column for “wasn’t interested in
                    applying, but now i might”. No huge surprise there. But when
                    we asked how many people in the workshops actually required
                    these flexibilities or planned to use them, only ~5% of
                    participants reported needing flex hours (for example, to do
                    school pick up).

                    So why did a factor that applicants admitted they didn’t
                    need have such an influence over their behaviour pattern?

                    The other surprising result from the workshops was also a
                    finding related to the way in which applicants were “coding”
                    the statements. More than 2/3rd of participants placed
                    government-style “motherhood” statements, such as “The
                    Government of Canada values diversity and inclusion in the
                    application process,” into the “now I don’t want to apply”
                    bucket. This actually shocked us, because why wouldn’t that
                    be something applicants wanted to see?

                        types of statements with a compliance-driven workplace
                        and a manager that said the things they were supposed to
                        say, not the things they really felt.</strong
                    >
                    Applicants reported that they in no way believed that the
                    inclusion of these motherhood-style statements meant the
                    manager actually cared about them or would uphold them in
                    practice. Some even reported that they found these
                    statements “just annoying noise” or offensive to the
                    intelligence of applicants, like a “poorly done magic trick”
                    trying to stop people from looking deeper at what was going
                    on.

                    As a result of this finding on adverse applicant reactions
                    to broad, motherhood-style statements in job advertisements,
                    we ran a second series of targeted qualitative analysis
                    experiments. These were done with real managers, but not for
                    real job processes in the initial experiment. We asked them
                    to start with a broad corporate statement they might usually
                    include in a job advertisement. Then we encouraged them to
                    personalize the sentiments behind the broad corporate
                    statements, and include this on a manager profile. For
                    example, instead of a broad statement on diversity and
                    employment equity, managers wrote things like, “I believe in
                    a workplace that supports Indigenous inclusion. While I’m
                    not Indigenous, I try to always encourage my scientists to
                    consider Indigenous traditional knowledge in their field
                    studies, and I try to always keep learning from Indigenous
                    colleagues and peers so I can be a better manager.”
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    We then took these real sentences, produced by real
                    managers, and tested them again with applicants.

                    The shift from broad statements to personal commitments was
                    so successful in beta testing with applicants that we wrote
                    nudges towards authenticity right into the job advertisement
                    builder that we coded for the platform, and included a
                    manager profile. Ongoing qualitative analysis with
                    applicants for real job processes in 2018-2020 showed that
                    this type of information remained an important factor in
                    influencing applicant behaviour favourably towards managers
                    and job applications. This proved particularly true when
                    managers admitted imperfections and provided bluntly honest
                    phrases, as these things generated a sense of trust in the
                    manager despite applicants never having met them. It made
                    people want to work with these managers.

                    We also helped managers see the value of flexibilities in
                    the recruitment process by setting new defaults in the job
                    advertisement builder around flex hours, telework and remote
                    work (which was discussed in detail in the previous write-up
                    in Section 2 of this report.) To see a screenshot of these

                    It was a surprising research finding for us to see the
                    extent to which applicants used small phrases and keywords
                    to draw much larger conclusions about managers, departments,
                    and workplace cultures. But it probably shouldn’t have been
                    a surprise at all. This observation is directly in line with
                    an increasing body of behavioural psychology and cognitive
                    sciences research produced in the last two decades that
                    looks at the ways in which the brain interprets fragments of
                    information.

                    That means that our applicants’ tendency to scan for “code
                    words” that would reveal insights about the broader work
                    environment was right on par with what one might expect
                    based on behavioural psychology research. But it’s not only
                    the applicants’ tendency to extrapolate information that
                    managers should care about when looking to improve their
                    recruitment strategy; it’s also learning what “code words”

                    job advertisements need to factor this applicant behaviour
                    pattern into their recruitment strategy.

                    This is more than a matter of adding a few keywords in key
                    places. If managers were to become formulaic about always
                    adding the same words,

                    The sample size for these workshops wasn’t large enough to
                    be considered statistically significant - we only engaged
                    ~120 people in total in the initial workshops, plus the
                    follow-up qualitative analysis, and the study of applicant
                    behaviour patterns in the live job processes. But the
                    findings were so consistent from the initial workshop
                    series, we decided to go ahead and build the lessons learned
                    into the platform in the form of default settings and
                    nudges.

                    While we made changes to our platform to promote these
                    behaviours, they come down to language choices. So there’s
                    no reason these approaches can’t be easily applied in any
                    job application process.

                    More broadly, the Government of Canada might want to run a
                    research study to better understand and confirm or refute
                    these findings. Motherhood-style statements are almost
                    ubiquitous in government job advertisements and as part of
                    recruitment drives. If that’s as big a problem as we
                    suspect, there’s a lot of high-performing talent out there
                    that might be nudged away from ever applying… without the
                    Government of Canada even realizing it was happening. And
                    that’s a loss for Canada.
