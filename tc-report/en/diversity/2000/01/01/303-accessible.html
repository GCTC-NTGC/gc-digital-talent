                    Our Philosophical Approach
                </h3>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Our team cares deeply about building for accessibility.
                    Accessibility is about making things that anyone can use.
                    It’s about investing the time in making a product that works
                    for everyone, and caring about how easy it is to use,
                    regardless of a person’s individual needs when it comes to
                    accessing content. Being a product team in government we are
                    afforded the time to do it right, which some of our
                    developers have lamented is not often the case in the
                    private sector.

                    In the context of an application that is always being
                    changed and improved, it’s not good enough to be accessible
                    at a single point in time. Even if it were, there are always
                    ways to improve further. Instead, we’re now thinking about
                    “being accessible” as a process of continuous improvement.

                    Every feature we build needs to be accessible, but like
                    making a great plate of nachos, you need the right
                    ingredients to even get started. For our team, a few things

                    Giving developers the tools to help them is also key. Over
                    time we’ve been able to build an in-house design system that
                    does a lot of the accessibility work for our developers:
                    ensuring color contrast is adequate, components like the
                    menu or modals (pop-ups) behave properly, and key
                    accessibility considerations are already built into the
                    design options.

                    Our design system, and application, are built to work on
                    screens of all sizes, whether computer screens or phones.
                    This is important for lots of users, but increasingly we
                    feel this is an important part of building an accessible
                    application. We can’t reliably make assumptions about the
                    ways people use assistive technologies or the devices they
                    need. People are diverse and we need to build accessible
                    products for as many use cases as we can. In today’s world,
                    that has to include mobile devices.

                    which can automatically catch some accessibility concerns,
                    have also become staples of our development process. These
                    tools can give you a false sense of accomplishment though
                    and rarely mean that your application is accessible on their
                    own. For us, getting these automated tools to pass at 100%
                    is the easy part, getting the application working acceptably
                    in the real world is the challenge.

                    For actual testing of our application with assistive
                    technologies, we’ve dabbled in using screen-readers
                    ourselves, but haven’t stuck with it. While useful, the
                    practice is flawed because we don’t use assistive
                    technologies the way someone who needs them everyday. Even
                    if we did, it’s still only one combination of assistive
                    technologies and there are many more to consider. Instead of
                    trying to do final accessibility testing ourselves, we now
                    rely on a third party service that connects us with real
                    people that use assistive technologies. The company we’ve
                    used for this is called

                    The best part is that these testers will be using a variety
                    of different browsers and assistive technologies, so you can
                    have more confidence that your application works for
                    everyone. Working with Fable allows Talent Cloud to
                    encounter and be tested against “edge cases” that wouldn’t
                    be caught by automated testing, but are a critical part of
                    building a truly inclusive product.

The first part is mocking features with the UX team, where an expert on the team is consulted to see if there are accessibility concerns (some features never make it past this point, even if people are excited about them) and issues are addressed or flagged for the development team. The second step is coding, where the feature must pass a series of automated tests at ~100% (this is the easy part, but it's not enough on its own) and the design system is updated, if necessary, to make future features easier to implement. The third step is accessibility testing with Fable, where features are tested with people who use multiple assistive technologies and browsers. This loop iterates until all concerns are addressed. The third step in the pipeline is releasing the feature, where any remaining issues raised by real users of the product are addressed."

                    Here are two before-and-after reports from Fable that we
                    received for the new reusable menu for our design system.
                    Our first attempt followed standard practices and we made
                    the assumption that tabbing through the menu would be the
                    best way to navigate it with the keyboard. We had heard that
                    menus could be some of the most difficult elements to
                    navigate with assistive technologies, so we were expecting
                    to have more work to do but the results were even worse than
                    expected. The menu seemed to work fine to us, but users were
                    simply unable to navigate it.

                    A lot of effort and research went into our second attempt.
                    Descriptive text was added to explain how to navigate the
                    menu, we switched to a combination of tabbing and arrow keys
                    for navigation, and the escape key was added to close
                    submenus to give just a few examples. The results of our
                    second round of testing were completely different. People
                    with a variety of combinations of assistive technology and
                    browsers were now able to complete the same tasks from
                    before. Menus can be difficult to get right, so this felt
                    like a big win for our team.

                    Our approach to building accessible applications has evolved
                    a lot since we first started. Because we’re always improving
                    our application, it means we are continuously working to
                    improve the accessibility of our site too. The lessons that
                    have been learned over the years about product design and
                    development are equally applicable to building for
                    accessibility. The best way to obtain the outcomes we want,
                    whether it’s cyber security, interactivity or accessibility,
                    is to build them into each part of the process and test with
                    real users. This has proven time and again, to be more
                    effective than tagging on a compliance exercise at the end
