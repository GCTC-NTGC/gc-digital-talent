                    Talent Cloud talks a lot about how much attention goes into
                    the representation of literally every form field, process
                    step and interaction on the platform for each of its user
                    groups. To give you a better sense of how much effort and
                    expertise it takes to get even a single form field or
                    intervention working so it produces the intended hiring
                    result (remember: focus on delivery!) we wanted to walk you
                    through the development of a single feature of our platform:
                    the essential education requirement in a job advertisement.

                <p>
                    Talent Cloud set-out to develop a platform designed to
                    attract, protect, and empower Indigenous talent to thrive
                    within the Federal Government. And to achieve this goal we
                    continuously design and test iteratively using user
                    research.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    In user research, critical failures occur when a user is
                    unable to achieve their goal. At Talent Cloud, every
                    qualified applicant should have a shot at a job they’re
                    interested in, and that starts with submitting an
                    application. Qualitative user research helps uncover the
                    hidden paths that prevent applicants from applying.
                </p>

                <!-- Basic Content -->
                <p>
                    Some of the earliest research on Talent Cloud focused on the
                    current job poster’s design, layout, and the information it
                    contained. But when we aim to attract a very specific subset
                    of the population, we need to design in conjunction with
                    that group, to address specific problems and design specific
                    solutions. We reached out to the Indigenous Community to
                    better understand their perspective as external job seekers,
                    with the hopes of uncovering critical failures in our
                    design.

                    A common myth in Government Hiring is that certain job
                    classifications require a certain type and level of
                    education degree. While that is true for a number of
                    positions, it is more often than not an overgeneralization.
                    The truth is that Hiring Managers can choose to accept any
                    number of qualifications and forgo an Educational
                    Requirement for many government classifications, as long as
                    an applicant's qualifications add up to an Equivalent
                    Experience.

                    Design principles state that information is generally
                    consumed Top-to-bottom and Left-to-right. And in addition
                    users “skim” information instead of reading it. Our first
                    skimmed elements are: Education Requirements -> Education
                    Degree or Diploma -> Equivalent Experience -> 2 years
                    post-secondary. As such, this design strongly prioritizes
                    Western education, diplomas, and degrees, as the most
                    important requirement to apply for the position. We learned
                    that even when applicants read the Equivalent Experience
                    section they wondered if a “hidden hierarchy” existed behind
                    the scenes, and whether they would have enough to compete
                    with applicants who had a degree.

                    Placing the two concepts side-by-side (rather than
                    above/below), was a deliberate choice. The attempt was to
                    reflect the absence of a hierarchy between the two options.
                    But by placing Education Degree Requirement first and
                    calling the alternative option Equivalent Experience we are
                    still showing a preference for the former and framing the
                    latter as a dependent lesser version. This layout change was
                    not enough to solve the problem.

                    Diversity creates higher quality products. As designers of
                    products and services we must remember the dangers of
                    implicit bias; It is invisible by nature and it hinders
                    representation. But if we make an effort to include the
                    voices missing from our teams, we can help mitigate some of
                    these errors. And we can finally begin to remove barriers
                    and do our part to advance reconciliation.

                    The emphasis on rethinking the representation for education
                    requirements for Indigenous applicants isn’t because
                    Indigenous talent doesn’t have that education. It’s because
                    we can’t, (underline absolutely can not) ignore the impact
                    of Canada’s residential schools on Indigenous talent and
                    assume a general willingness on behalf of the Indigenous
                    community to accept the primacy of the Western education
                    system in the job application process. For GC hiring
                    processes to engage this way with Indigenous talent risks
                    perpetuating ignorance, indifference and racism.

                    It’s important to note that while the work on how education

                        All Government systems were built by people… and people
                        grow up in communities and come with histories,
                        cultures, and values. It can be hard to spot the
                        underlying culture-based assumptions built into systems
                        design, especially when the group that designed the
                        system is the same group attempting to identify
                        assumptions in the system. But these assumptions can
                        have a big impact on the experiential equality of
                        inclusion. The first step towards inclusive design is
                        the acknowledgement that everything in a system was
                        built by people, and because of this, people can change
                        it. Making the change means engaging people from
                        communities that were underrepresented when the original
                        system was created, and giving power to new voices in
