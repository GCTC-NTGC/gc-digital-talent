                    The Indigenous Talent Portal is designed to provide a space
                    where Indigenous talent can browse and apply to Public
                    Service employment opportunities aimed at the recruitment of
                    Indigenous talent. They can also browse jobs open to the

                    The Government of Canada is not an easy place to work for
                    many Indigenous people. Systemic racism and discrimination
                    are still an ongoing reality, despite a growing effort
                    across the Public Service to address issues, change
                    behaviours, and remove barriers. But systemic racism several
                    hundred years in the making doesn’t disappear overnight, nor
                    does the legacy of its presence in the memories and
                    experiences of Indigenous people.

                    The Indigenous Talent Portal is being developed for the
                    Indigenous community - with decisions and directions set by
                    the Indigenous community - “to reclaim our stories and to
                    reset the way Indigenous talent is valued.”

                    In a time of reconciliation, there was no way Talent Cloud
                    could consider building a new model for talent recruitment
                    that didn’t put the needs of Indigenous talent at the heart
                    of the design, (as well as the needs of other
                    underrepresented and equity-seeking groups). For Indigenous
                    talent, the trust between government and community is
                    broken. To rebuild trust, we begin by rebuilding a new
                    process, together. That means making choices, like hiring
                    our Indigenous Community Liaison before our first developers
                    created the first line of code for the platform. Inclusion
                    cannot be an afterthought. It is, by its very definition, at
                    the heart of the model.

                        In an environment where many of our user testers were
                        residential school survivors or the children of
                        residential school survivors, talking to people about
                        working for government and trusting government with
                        personal information wasn’t like the discussions we had
                        with other user groups. There is a difficult history and
                        a context here that has to be honoured, and to honour
                        it, you first have to acknowledge it. In this case, that
                        meant changing our approach to user testing. The team
                        worked with our Indigenous Community Liaison to find
                        spaces where smudging could be conducted at workshop
                        sessions, and seats could be arranged in a circle. Our
                        Indigenous Community Liaison also took care to
                        acknowledge traditional territories, and to speak in her
                        community’s language whenever possible. We kept Kleenex
                        boxes on tables. Our Indigenous Community Liaison cooked
                        and shared traditional foods. The team brought cookies
                        and chocolate.

                        Indigenous public servants with various degrees of
                        seniority to understand early and long term issues
                        related to recruitment, onboarding, work environment,
                        and career advancement. The team brought several issues
                        back for multiple rounds of discussion, clarifying our
                        understanding of the issues, desires, and concerns of
                        Indigenous employees before we moved on to user testing.

                        were engaged in discussions, and later the reviewing of
                        designs, as well as individual members of various
                        Indigenous communities who would be the type of talent

                        going over every text box, process step, image, and
                        function on the portal. Many of these prototype designs
                        involved very difficult issues, such as
                        self-identification. Several of these components are
                        still being finalized with all groups involved, and some
                        features may need to be tested live, and then revised.
                        Some features also represent a significant departure in
                        thinking from the way data like this is normally
                        collected and represented on Government of Canada sites,
                        which is why our team has endeavoured to always keep
                        Indigenous communities at the steering wheel when it
                        comes to design. There isn’t always agreement between
                        communities, either. And working through these design
                        issues with communities until it’s right is part of our
                        Digital Standards commitment to empowering users in the
                        design process.

                        During user testing sessions, the issue of the value of
                        Indigenous languages, and the challenge of bilingualism,
                        came up over and over again (effectively, having to
                        learn two colonial languages in order to advance in a
                        public service career, while Indigenous languages aren’t
                        recognized). It was a contentious and painful
                        discussion. So early on, our team decided that at least
                        some of our Indigenous Community Liaison’s time every
                        week would be devoted to working on this issue, even
                        though it wasn’t a part of our mandate and our platform
                        features plan. So why do it? Because when a team in the
                        Government of Canada asks Indigenous communities to give
                        time and stories and ideas and emotional investment to
                        something, that team should give back. In our case, that
                        meant dedicating some of our team resources to support
                        work done by the Indigenous Federal Employees Network on
                        advancing a proposal of ideas on this issue. This isn’t
                        a Talent Cloud initiative. It’s just a chance to show
                        our acknowledgement of the struggles and barriers faced
                        by Indigenous talent inside the Government of Canada,
                        even today, and to do what we can to help with this.

                        An add-on program is an initiative that seeks to close a
                        gap in performance outcomes by providing an additional
                        service, above and beyond the main program’s operations,
                        such as a targeted recruitment program for Indigenous
                        employees or a mentoring program for women executives.
                        These types of initiatives can be extremely valuable in
                        advancing inclusion and diversity… but they can also be
                        problematic. So how can a team looking to address gaps
                        in outcomes know whether the initiative is likely to
                        help or hurt?

                        An add-on program that fills a unmet need, while
                        generating structural changes to the central program,
                        contributes to the advancement of inclusion. An add-on
                        program that is created so the central program doesn’t
                        have to be changed contributes to systemic
                        discrimination. If there is an inequality in the power
                        dynamics, structural design, and choice architecture at
                        the foundation of the central program, no amount of
                        additional programming offered elsewhere will produce a
                        long-term corrective step towards equality. The end goal
                        of an add-on program should be deep systemic change. As
                        long as this is the compass bearing that informs
                        decisions, it’s at least starting out pointing in the
                        right direction.

                    The restrictions related to privacy and Talent Cloud’s cloud
                    server environment have meant that we haven’t yet been given
                    permission to launch the Indigenous Talent Portal. This was
                    because use of the Indigenous Talent Portal by applicants
                    was deemed to be an expression of their employment equity
                    status, which is information that can’t be collected on a
                    server that doesn’t allow for Protected B data collection.
                    (See Protected B and the Move to Cloud in Section 1.)

                    The design and user testing of the Indigenous Talent Portal
                    is in advanced stages, and ongoing efforts have been made to
                    make sure that members of the Indigenous community were able
                    to direct the work and the features at all stages of design.
                    But due to the restrictions on release, Talent Cloud hasn’t
                    launched final steps in the development phase. While much of
                    the design is set up to integrate with and leverage existing
                    features on the Talent Cloud platform, and the system of
                    portals is in place, it would still take a few developers
                    and a few months to get this portal live, plus work from our
                    Indigenous Community Liaison.

                    Currently, there are no funding partners to support this
                    work going forward, although there have been a few dozen
                    managers who have already come forward asking to post
                    positions on the portal. There seems to be strong demand for
                    teams looking to increase the diversity of their talent. The
                    Indigenous Federal Employees Network has also identified the
                    value in Indigenous employees being able to post profiles
                    and find opportunities for internal mobility, development,
                    and promotion. The team continues to try to seek resources
                    and support for this endeavour.

                <p>
                    The honesty pledge allows self-declaration of Indigenous
                    status, while being respectful of individual identity.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The options have been presented as checkboxes so
                        multiple affiliations could be indicated if needed.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A carousel was introduced for the options so that no
                        community would be above another.

                        Allows space for individuals who may not be able to
                        trace their ties to a specific community by including an
                        option separate from Métis. (This was in response to
                        expressions of frustration from members of the Métis
                        community. They raised the issue of Indigenous people
                        without clear ties to a specific Indigenous community
                        sometimes selecting the category of Métis on government
                        forms because they didn’t self-identify as Inuit or
                        First Nations, and there was no other option.) This
                        feature introduces a number of complexities around
                        identity and belonging, and is still in active testing.
                        There is a strong likelihood that it will need to go
                        through several more rounds of refinement, given the
                        sensitivity of the topic.

                        All Canadians are permitted to apply to any Government
                        of Canada position. The “ally” option provides an
                        opportunity for honesty for those who are not
                        Indigenous, but perhaps have ties to the Indigenous
                        community or Indigenous cultural competencies. These
                        applicants may still be considered for the position, but
                        priority is intended to be given to indigenous talent. A
                        link is also provided to redirect people who no longer
                        feel they are a good fit for the opportunity. The
                        intention behind this series of choices and nudges is to
                        deter those who might not be Indigenous, but see
                        themselves as connected to Indigenous identity, to have
                        options of representation other than a false claim of
                        Indigenous ancestry. False claims of Indigeneity, and
                        the friction and harm this causes for Indigenous
                        communities, was something that was raised repeatedly in
                        workshops, and Indigenous users asked us to test
                        approaches for addressing it. Ultimately, falsely making
                        such a claim is a form of racism, and it’s a behaviour
                        we wanted to discourage on the platform. We worked with
                        both behavioural sciences and Indigenous experts to come
                        up with this initial intervention. But it is in need of
                        testing, and will require several rounds of refinement.
