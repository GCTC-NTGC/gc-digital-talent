# Environment Variables

Environment variables are created and used in many places throughout the repo.  This document covers the use of environment variables in a development environment.  Environment management in production is out of scope.

## Laravel

The [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) project **api** reads environment variables from the `.env` file in the root of its project directory. These files are not checked into version control. When running the setup scripts, a new one is copied from the `.env.example` template and then customized. In a development environment, these files are reread on every new PHP request. If needed, a configuration reset can be forced with `php artisan config:clear`.

## Frontend

The frontend [React](https://reactjs.org/) projects uses environment variables in two distinct ways: **build-time** variables and **run-time** variables.

### Build-Time Variables

The **frontend** subprojects (admin, talentsearch) have `.env` files that are copied from `.env.example` template files like the Laravel project. When the frontend projects are built using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), variables from the `.env` file are defined in the resulting bundle using [DefinePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/). These values are "baked into" the bundle and if there are any variable changes, the subproject must be rebuilt to reflect them.

### Run-Time Variables

For deployment in production, there needs to be a way to change variables in the program without rebuilding. This allows us to use environment variables as "feature flags", which enable/disable specific features with the same deployed code artifact. This is done using [envsubst](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/envsubst-Invocation.html) to fill environment variables into the `config.js` files while setting up the app service, post-deploy. In a development environment, these variables are injected into the `config.js` files by webpack during build. To update these variables locally, just update the `.env` file and rebuild the bundle.

To check what variables have been set in the app, open the console of your browser and enter:
`window.__SERVER_CONFIG__`
