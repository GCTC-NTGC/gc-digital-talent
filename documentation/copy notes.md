## Forms
### Accessibility
-	**Checkbox and radio button questions**: either introduce the options with a generic label and present full sentences for selection, or use a label that is a question and provide complete answers.

### Point of view
-	Typically, we use the first person to describe answers in a form.
    * E.g.: [   ] I am willing to work occasional overtime. 
    * And not: [   ] ~~You are willing to work occasional overtime~~.

## Punctuation
-	Generally, we don’t use **quotation marks** for answers in forms.
    * Exception: Indigenous identity – In forms providing the possibility to indicate identification with an Indigenous community, quotation marks are intentionally included to emphasize the significance.
- Avoid using **slashes** when possible.
    * For example, say "City or town" and not "~~City/town~~"
  

## Impératif vs. infinitif
Generally:
-	Use infinitif for headings
-	Use impératif for descriptions
-	Use impératif for buttons that entail a concrete action

However:
-	Use impératif for headings that include a possessive pronoun/adjective (often found on pages that request concrete info or actions from the users)
-	Use infinitif for buttons that are more generic. (For example that lead to more information (e.g. Learn more, Expand all, View results, Browse jobs))

See for more info on the distinction between impératif and inifinitif the website of the [Office quebecois de la langue française](https://vitrinelinguistique.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/24208/la-grammaire/le-verbe/modes/imperatif/distinction-entre-limperatif-et-linfinitif).
## Capitalization
[…]
## Inclusive writing in French
Aim to use neutral formulation whenever possible. This includes using collective nouns, gender-neutral words (nouns, adjectives, pronouns), and rephrasing when necessary.
For more details, see the GC’s [Clés de la redaction](https://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/fr/cles-de-la-redaction/ecriture-inclusive-lignes-directrices-ressources) or the guidelines from the [Office québecois de la langue française](https://vitrinelinguistique.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/25030/banque-de-depannage-linguistique/la-redaction-et-la-communication/redaction-pour-le-web/redaction-epicene-sur-le-web). 
### Doublets
-	It is generally recommended to use full doublets instead of abbreviated doublets. 
    * E.g. : « les étudiantes et étudiants » instead of « les étudiant(e)s.
-	Exception: when space is limited (such as in tables), the abbreviated doublets are acceptable.
