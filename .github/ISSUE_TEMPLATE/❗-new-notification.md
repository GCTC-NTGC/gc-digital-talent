## ✨ Purpose

<!-- What is this notification intended to convey, and why? -->

## ❗ Trigger

<!--
How is this notification generated? Is it in response to some user action (eg submitting a request) or will it require a cron job which runs on a schedule (eg a job poster closes in 24 hours). If it requires a cron job, how often does it need to run?
 -->

## 👀 Audience

<!--
Who will get this notification? (eg all Request Responders, or only applicants with a draft application for related poster)
 -->

## 🌎 Copy (localized)

### Email templates (English and French)

<!-- Content of this notification if received as an email. -->

### In-app string (English and French)

<!-- How does this notification appear on the notifications page? -->

### Link

<!--
What page of the app is most relevant to this notification? (You will be sent there if you click this notification in-app.) Consider if this link should be part of the email template.
 -->

## 💾 Content

<!--
- What Notification Family does this belong to? (see #9555)
- What is the minimal set of data we need to store in the database in order to generate in-app string and link?
 -->
