  # This ignores all updates to tc-report, since it's now served as a static website.
  #
  #   * We will occasionally still get security vulnerability warnings, for
  #     which merging the dependabot PR will NOT update the static website.
  #     Update would require a manually rebuild.
  #
  #   * Rebuild is likely not necessary because the website is only a simple
  #     front-end.
  #
  #  * We can't disable security vulnerability PRs without disabling for the whole repo.
