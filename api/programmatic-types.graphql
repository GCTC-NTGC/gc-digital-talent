The `ID` scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to
refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON
response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable.
When expected as an input type, any string (such as `"4"`) or integer
(such as `4`) input value will be accepted as an ID.

The fundamental unit of any GraphQL Schema is the type. There are many kinds of

type. Scalar types provide no information beyond a name and description, while
Enum types provide their values. Object and Interface types provide the fields
they describe. Abstract types, Union and Interface, provide the Object types
possible at runtime. List and NonNull types compose other types.
