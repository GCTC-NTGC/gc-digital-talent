# Example

A simple component to demonstrate some best practices with React and Storybook.

# MDX

MDX files mix Markdown and Javascript/JSX to create rich interactive documentation. You can use Markdownâ€™s readable syntax (such as # heading) for your documentation, include stories defined in Component Story Format (CSF), and freely embed JSX component blocks at any point in the file. All at once.
