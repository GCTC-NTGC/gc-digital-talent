# Example files

This directory is intended to demonstrate the best practices that we aim for with components.

## Storybook

We define stories according to the [Component Story Format](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf) (CSF), an ES6 module-based standard that is easy to write and portable between tools.

Review the files in this directory for examples.
