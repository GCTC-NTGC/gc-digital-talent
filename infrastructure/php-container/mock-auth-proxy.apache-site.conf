# This was copied directly out of docker container, and uses defaults except
# for proxy settings indicated at (1) and (2) below.

# (1) These port 8000 settings are custom.
# Note: This allows the auth server to be found at localhost:8000 whether call
# is made from outside container (from browser on host) or from inside
# container (from API app). This is required because docker-compose.yml maps
# port 8000 on host to internal container port 80.
#
#     REQUEST FROM HOST BROWSER:
#     localhost:8000 (host) => localhost:80   (php container) => mock-auth:8080 (mock-auth container)
#
#     REQUEST FROM API APP:
#                              localhost:8000 (php container) => mock-auth:8080 (mock-auth container)

	# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
	# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
	# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
	# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
	#ServerName www.example.com
